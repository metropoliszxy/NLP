If I

  If I walk,would you run?  If I stop,would you come?  If I say you are the one,would you believe me?  If I ask you to stay,would you show me the way?  Tell me what to say so you don't leave me   The world is catching up to you while you are running away to chase your dreams  It's time for us to make a move cause we are asking one another to change and maybe I'm not ready but I'll try for your love  I can hide up above  I will try for your love  We've been hiding enough  I will try for your love
