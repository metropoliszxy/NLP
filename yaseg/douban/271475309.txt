Jazz is my aphrodisiacs

Jazz is atonal. notes come up randomly as strangers passes by. sometimes, even chaotically like turbulence in the river.The unexpected appears without any sign. Have no idea about how lunatic I can be, just following and drifting with desire like wild animals.Funky boy, stylish groom, I smelt the scent of Eros. Your Psyche, has been lingering too long on the land of nowhere, cannot wait to greet her beloved.
