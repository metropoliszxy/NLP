已哥们写的求婚辞

You know, my life was full of solitary，gloomy, with no conviction， and no loveAnd this hadn’t changed until one girl came into my world.Her eyes, her smile, her innocent appearance capture my soul.And I am always wondering how I can preserve all these beautiful things.So now, what I have to do Is just show my love to this girlWhose name is Rain, Who redefines my understanding of loveAnd Who is just standing in front of me.Yeah That’s you rainYou’ve become a part of my life.This ring represents my heart, but I still need one thing from you.That’sYes, I DO.Rain, will you marry me?
