fed up with it

I'm so fed up with the acnes and all the skin problems. They are all over the place. Just when one spot disappears, another three pop up. There is never an end to it. I guess it's just one of the things you have to put up with in life. lucky I have this instead of cancer. it sucks, but at least it doesn't kill me.
