Looking from the window aboveIts like a story of love.Can you hear me?Came back only yesterday,Moving farther away.Want you near me.All I needed was the love you game.All I needed for another dayAnd all I ever knew;Only you.Sometimes when I think of her nameWhen it's only a gameAnd I need you.Listen to the words that you say,It's getting harder to stayWhen I see you.All I needed was the love you game.All I needed for another dayAnd all I ever knew;Only you.All I needed was the love you game.All I needed for another dayAnd all I ever knew;Only you.This is gonna take a long timeAnd I wonder what's mine.Can't take no more.Wonder if you'll understandIt's just the touch of your hand,Behind closed doors.All I needed was the love you game.All I needed for another dayAnd all I ever knew;Only you
