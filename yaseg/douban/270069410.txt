慢慢看……One for sorrowTwo for mirthThree for a funeralFour for a birthFive for heavenSix for hellSeven's the Devil his own selfKing and Queen of Cantelon,How many miles to Babylon?Eight and eight, and other eight.Will I get there by candle-light?If your horse be good and your spurs be bright.How mony men have ye?Mae nor ye daur come and see.Sing a song of sixpence,A pocket full of rye.Four and twenty blackbirds,Baked in a pie.When the pie was opened,The birds began to sing;Wasn't that a dainty dish,To set before the king?The king was in his counting house,Counting out his money;The queen was in the parlour,Eating bread and honey.The maid was in the garden,Hanging out the clothes,When down came a blackbirdAnd pecked off her nose.
