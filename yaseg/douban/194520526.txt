 Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up;Does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;Does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;Bears all things, believe that things, hopes all things, endures all things.Love never fails.
