死亡幻觉里的一段（更加睡不着了……好怕啊现在……

　Dear Roberta Sparrow,　　　　...　　　　Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me.　　　　Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me this is not a work of fiction.　　　　I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep.　　　　I hope that when the world comes to an end,I can breathe a sigh of relief,　　　　because there will be so much to look forward to.　　　　Donnie Darko　　October 25th,1988
