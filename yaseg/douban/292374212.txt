People don’t think anymore, they feel

"People don’t think anymore, they feel, “how are you feeling?”, “oh, i don’t feel comfortable”, “oh i’m so sorry, we, the group, we’re feeling”… Do you know, one of the great problems of our age is that we are governed by people who care more about feelings that they do about thoughts and ideas. Now, Thoughts and ideas, that interests me. Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Watch your words, for they become actions. Watch your actions, for they become habits. Watch your habits, for they become your character. Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny."— From the movie The Iron Lady (2011)
