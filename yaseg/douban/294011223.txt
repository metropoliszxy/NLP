A fragment of a 5th-century Greek play

There was a time when human life was without order and bestial and ruled by brute force,when there was neither any reward for the goodnor any punishment for the bad. And then, I think, men established punitive laws, so that Justice would be ruler of all<…> and have Hubris in chains.Whoever did wrong was punished. Then, given that the laws held people back fromopenly committing violent deedsbut they still did them in secret, at that time I think <…> some man of shrewd and intelligent character hit upon the idea of inventing the gods for mortals, sothat bad people would have something to fear even when they acted or spoke or schemed in secret.
