Rolling In The Deep

There’s a fire starting in my heartReaching a fever pitch it’s bringing me out the darkFinally I can see you crystal clearGo head and sell me out and ill lay your ship thereSee how I leave with every piece of youDon’t underestimate the things that I will do There’s a fire starting in my heartReaching a fever pitchAnd its bring me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of usThey keep me thinking that we almost had it allThe scars of your love they leave me breathlessI can’t help feelingWe could have had it allRolling in the deepYou had my heart and soulAnd you played itTo the beat Baby I have no story to be toldBut I’ve heard one of youAnd I’m gonna make your head burnThink of me in the depths of your despairMaking a home down thereIt Reminds you of the home we shared The scars of your love remind me of usThey keep me thinking that we almost had it allThe scars of your love they leave me breathlessI can’t help feelingWe could have had it allRolling in the deepYou had my heart and soulAnd you played itTo the beatWe could have had it allRolling in the deepYou had my heart and soulAnd you played itTo the beat Throw your soul through every open doorCount your blessings to find what you look forTurned my sorrow into treasured goldYou pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow We could have had it allWe could have had it allIt all, it all it all,We could have had it allRolling in the deepYou had my heart and soulAnd you played itTo the beat循环了好久的歌喜欢上那种偏爵士的鼓点finally……
