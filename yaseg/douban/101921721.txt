Birthday of My Niece

Yesterday was my niece’s birthday, so I went to my sister’s and we had lunch together in a Hubei restaurant. The little girl is 2-year old now, so cute that I like her very much. I come back this afternoon. There is a traffic jam. Cars and buses move very slowly. I just close my eyes and listen to the radio. It’s easy coffee time at FM 91.5, which is one of my favorite.  2 hours have passed when I finally got home. The same distance yesterday morning cost less than one and a half hour. I hope the Line 4 Daxing could go into service as soon as possible. As the trial operation has started last month, I don’t think I have to wait for a long time.It’s getting dark very quickly these days. I arrive home at about 4:50 p.m., and It’s all dark outside after almost 20 minutes later. I make a bowl of noodles for myself. After finishing my simple supper, Icall my friend Xiao Dai. I visited her to see her new baby last month, and we haven’t had a chat since then.We have a quite nice chat, then she has to leave to feed her baby, a pretty little girl with long and slim limbs, which predicts that she will be tall.Facing success or failure, it’s no need to care too much.Only if I’ve tried my best, it’s enough for my simple life.-Jack London Life is a Journey
