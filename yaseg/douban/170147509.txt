 看了一句话：This happened to me a lot: I hate when people you weren't really aware of, come after you like you were special, making you think they really need you and, once they stir up your interest, worse when you're hooked, they drop you like an old shoe, treating you like if it was YOU who were chasing them all the time, turning the situation in reverse so that it'd look you were on their backs... It Feels like you've been had and leaves a sour taste in your mouth! This usually happens when you're straight and Honest.卧槽泥马勒戈壁 !!!
