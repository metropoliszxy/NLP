Post-Impressionism: (1886 and to the early 1900s.)印象主义后期这个时期呢...还是延续了像monet那样还算唯美的画风...跟后来的modern art比 真的真的算很美妙了。在这里有3个非常非常有名的画家: Paul Cezaane, Paul Gauguin, 和我们伟大的Vincent Van Gogh. 和之前的印象主义画家不同，新的画家不只是关注描述客观现实，更加在乎放入自己的感情。而这3个最有名的画家，每个人也有不同的发展和关注的subject。1)Paul Cezanne: -did the most influence with the movement.-concern with how to paint. -Analyze the way to paint-new way to represent the world. (What Cezanne always represented was his own personal reaction to what he saw - a kind of psychological realism.)-use light: pay attention to light at different angle on different things.His main works:￼ ￼ ￼Portrait of the Artist’s Father (1886): different perspectives; how we see the world not in a static point. Eyes are moving.￼ Still life with Plaster Cupid (1895): different points of view; unclear physical imaginary space; capture an embodied nature.￼    Mont Sainte-Victoire 1886-90: the sense of space is emotive rather than descriptive. 2) Paul Gauguin: (1848-1930) Primitivism: characterized by exaggerated body proportions, animal totems, geometric designs and stark contrasts, the first artist to systematically use these effects and achieve broad public success was Paul Gauguin. (from Wiki)Foreign cultures: raw power and simplicityHe lives like his art: unique style caused by an attitude of mind.His Works:￼Vision after the Sermon, Jacob Wrestling an Angel (1888): symbolic landscape and the relationship between the observer and the observed. impossible to separate the painting into subject and object, observer and observed.￼Paul Gauguin, Self-Portrait as Jean Valijean from Les Miserables (1888): “Gauguin’s employ the idea of symbolic reference to something other than the ostensible subject.” an independent Idea. Symbolic. ￼Manao Tupapau, The Spectre Watches Her (1892)Vincent Van Gogh: Fauvism: (1900 - 1910)        - short-lived movement; France was special.
