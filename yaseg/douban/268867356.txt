【翻唱】Somewhere

选自West Side Story。用的Glee版本的伴奏，是删减过的。There's a place for usSomewhere a place for usPeace and quiet and open airWait for usSomewhereThere's a time for usSome day a time for usTime together with time to spareTime to learn, time to careSome daySomewhereWe'll find a new way of livingWe'll find a way of forgivingSomewhere SomewhereThere's a place for usA time and a place for usHold my hand and we're halfway thereHold my hand and I'll take you thereSome daySomehowSomewhere希望针对Prop 8和DOMA的听证会能有好的结果。Peace and quiet and open air wait for us somewhere, some day.
