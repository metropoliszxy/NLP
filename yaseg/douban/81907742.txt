Languages

OK let me list my languages to be learnt during this holiday: Japanese is the first and foremost cuz I'll take exam this december. The most important.Oral French should also be reviewed because I may have the chance to talk to French people all the time. One oral French book will really be enough. 20 minutes in a day.Finnish. OK first I promised to learn this language in summer holiday, and secondly it is such a nice language. Sounds really beautiful and I love Finland. And I can't postpone it like forever because I started learning Finnish like 4 years ago which I have really started. Now it's time to finish it.And Icelandic. For the same reason above.Portuguese. I should at least finish its pronunciation part. And I can read thru the whole book and learn some words if possible.Dutch. Ocasionally I get chances to meet dutch people now and then. I should at least finish Colloquial Dutch, just in case.OK I think that's all. My damn dog's barking and I hate him like this. I go shut him up and then go to bed. Good night~
