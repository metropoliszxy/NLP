[MARVEL] Thor&Loki 一部分漫画的对白记录

漫画神展开...死了好多次好多次重生 ╮(￣▽￣")╭  不说西皮不西皮啦 不管是北欧神话里还是漫画里觉得这俩"兄弟"关系非常微妙特别是loki的性格 涉及的漫画[Raganarok] [Rebirth] [Seige] [Thor] [The Mighty Thor] [Fear Itself] [Journey into Mystery]诸神的黄昏轮回了好多次 ← 传说中是Loki挑起的嘛.. Thor决定打破这个轮回 同归于尽神马的= =Thor: If only it were so now,that I could bring back our friend and families.how many time must I see them die.mother,father...my brothers.how much I miss them.child: Even Loki?Volstagg: Say not his name!Thor: No,no,that's okay.boy,yes,he too.I wish I had back.Volstagg: What?Thor: Once we were children.Balder,Loki,Vidar and I. Sif would play with us.Loki is my brother and I once loved even his mischievous nature.It seems now he is doomed to it.Loki死掉之后转生成正太~Thor不顾众神反对要把他找回来Sif 问他为啥要惦记着Loki 觉得没有他更好Thor: He made me laugh like no one else alive,Sif.His charm,his cleverness.We hunted together.As boys,I was never happier.I miss my brother,beloved.I miss my brother.Thor: All this loss wouldn't be so bad to bear,were I granted someone to bear it with,someone of   my blood,of my flesh.I miss my brother.I think I shall bring him back.For all the wretchedness of your past lives...I cannot imagine my present life without you.I brought you back and sought you out to bring you home,brother.Odin的兄弟the serpent从封印中跑出来了 预言说thor能打败他但是会同归于尽 Odin要把地球变成战场然后thor为了保护地球真的同归于尽了= =Loki为了救Thor把世界之树的种子藏起来被不明真相的Thor骂了 后来向他道歉Thor: I know...I know you had the best of intentions even if you used the worst of methods to execute them.My anger got the best of me,you are my brother and I love you.Loki: Do you trust me?Thor: Don't be stupid.Get some rest,Loki.Loki四处集结各方力量保证Thor能有胜过the serpent的机会(虽然知道他们会同归于尽)Thor不同意Odin把地球变成战场的决定被关起来了,Loki寻找同盟之前去问Thor.Loki :If you knew something bad was happening.What would you do?Thor: I would prevent it.Loki: But if something bad was happening,and it had to happen.And if it didn't happen,something even worse would happen.What would you do?Thor: I would make sure it happened.Loki: Even if it cost you everything?Thor: Aye.But Loki,what are you planning?Loki: What needs to be done.Brother.If you would do it.I should too.No matter what is costs me.Thor与the serpent同归于尽后Loki在山坡上流泪 (Ikol是上一世的Loki变成了一只喜鹊在正太Loki身边)Loki,son of Laufey,adopted of Odin,tied his brother to the altar of the future and passed fate the knife.And Ikol thinks...Old Loki longed for his brother's death and failed.It was his relatively innocent young self who successed-----and did it to help Thor.And that success may destroy the boy.There is irony here that even a simpler bird than Ikol could spot.Thor took nine steps and fell.Whatever the next step is.Loki will take it alone.正太Loki超级萌... 不过Thor..之前看的动画似乎没有这么喜欢Loki的样子= =
