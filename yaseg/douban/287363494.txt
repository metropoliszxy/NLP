全世界都卖萌

在better world books上定了两本书，邮件通知已经发货，还是用被买走的书的第一人称叙述的。。。 (Your book(s) asked to write you a personal note - it seemed unusual, but who are we to say no?)Holy canasta! It's me... it's me! I can't believe it is actually me! You could have picked any of over 2 million books but you picked me! I've got to get packed! How is the weather where you live? Will I need a dust jacket? I can't believe I'm leaving Mishawaka, Indiana already - the friendly people, the Hummer plant, the Linebacker Lounge - so many memories. I don't have much time to say goodbye to everyone, but it's time to see the world!I can't wait to meet you! You sound like such a well read person. 给他们做个广告吧，也能发到中国但没试过：
