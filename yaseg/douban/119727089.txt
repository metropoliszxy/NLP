Jaw  is mainly used to crush kinds of mining stone primarily, and the largest compression resistance of the material to be crushed is 320MPa. The jaw copper crusher is widely used in stone mining, metall-urgical industry, building material, highway, railway, and chemical industry. Working Principle of Jaw  The motor transmits power through belt, drives the moving jaw do periodic motion to the fixed jaw surround the eccentric shaft. The angle between toggle plate and moving jaw increases when moving jaw moves up. So the moving jaw closes to the fixed jaw. The stuff will be crushed in this process. The angle between toggle plate and moving jaw decreases when moving jaw moves down, the moving jaw moves away from fixed jaw by the pulling of rod and spring, the products such as stone after crushing will be discharged from the outlet. Characteristics of Jaw :High ratio of crushing, homogeneous final grain size, simple structure, reliable working condition, easy maintenance, low operating cost.. Working principle: The motor drives the main shaft and every turnplate through the reducer. The reducer drives dozens of rollers to rotate against race way of ring through pin. Small materials crushed by hammer copper crusher is transported into hopper by elevator, and then vibrating feeder shall feed material to the central part of upper turnplate evenly. The material falls to circle under the centrifugal force and comes down to raceway of ring to be crushed into powder. After grinded in the first race way, the material goes to the second and third turnplate. The blower inhales the external air into the mill and carries the powder after third turnplate into powder-separator. Turbine in the separator makes the coarse powder drop down and regrinded and the fine powder shall go into cyclone powder collector together with air current and go down through discharge valve as final product; at the same time, air current with a little dusts goes out through blower and muffler after purified by filter. Capabilities and Characteristics: Three-Ring & Medium-Speed MicroPowder Mill has high efficiency and low cost. Its capacity is raised by 40% compared with airflow mill and mix mill on the condition that the materials, the drive and the fineness of the final powder are the same. The life span of tear & wear parts is more than that of straight impact copper crusher and turbine mill under the circumstance of same materials and fineness of the final powder. Usually, its life span is more than one year. There is no rolling bearing and screw in the grinding cavity, so as to avoid the damage to the machine caused by tear & wear of bearing and seals and the looseness of screws. The fineness of powder can reach ï¿½5m with d97 once.
