The song is about lost hopes and dreams and all the plans we had, all put on hold for one reason or another, then sort of just forgotten, no matter how much we once believed in ourselves. But now its too late, life has passed us by...but we accept it, making the best of the life we have left until the "later parade" (heaven).
