as compared to students in Tier-I colleges.

A large number of employable talent lies in Tier-II colleges and cities, which are generally ignored by companies for placements, thereby creating an artificial dip in employable talent pool, a study says.The study indicates that in Tier-II colleges 3.47 per cent of students are employable in IT product, 16.4 per cent in IT services and 8.26 per cent in knowledge-process outsourcing (KPO). In contrast, 29.4 per cent students in Tier-I campuses are employable in IT services companies, whereas 10 per cent are employable in IT product companies, the study added. BPO and technical-support-job employability do not change much in Tier-II colleges, as compared to Tier-I colleges. Interestingly,, students in Tier-II colleges,, show a gap in number skills and not in English, as is commonly believed. Tier-II colleges students show a gap of 20 percentile points in English communication, logical ability and computer programming, while the gap in quantitative ability is 27 percentile points, as compared to students in Tier-I colleges. The study shows that the difference in employability for female versus male technical graduates is not more than two percentage points in any IT/ITeS sector. Females performed better than males in English and computer programming, while, males did better in logical ability and quantitative ability. Under the study, top 100 campuses and their employability were compared with the Tier-II campuses. Employability was based on actual testing of students from these campuses on their skills using AMCAT, a computer-based employability measurement test widely accepted in the industry.According to a study conducted by Aspiring Minds,, a recruitment assessment company, it appears that Tier-II colleges have a moderate pool of employable talent, which is often ignored by companies.
