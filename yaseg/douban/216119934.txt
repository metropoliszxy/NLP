.Chuckie CHUCKIE：It's a way outta here. 那不是就可以离开这里了。 WILL：What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next-door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field. 为什么要离开？我想要一辈子住在这儿。和你做邻居,一起带着我们的儿子去打棒球。 CHUCKIE：Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the Patriots’ games and still workin' construction, I'll kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I’ll kill you. 听着，你是我的死党,这不会变的。但如果20年后你还住在这儿，还到我家看球赛,还在盖房子，我他妈的会杀了你。那不是恐吓,我会宰了你的。 WILL：Chuckie, what are you talkin'... 你在胡扯什么? CHUCKIE：Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have. 听着，你有着我们都没有的天赋。 WILL：Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to? 拜托,为何大家都这么说？我辜负了自己吗？如果我自己本就不想有呢？ CHUCKIE：Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a insult to us if you're still here in twenty years. 不...你没有对不起自己，是你对不起我。因为我明天醒来五十岁了，还在干这种事,无所谓，而你已拥有百万奖券，却窝囊的不敢兑现,狗屁。我会不惜一切交换你所拥有的，其他这些人也是。你再待20年是侮辱我们，窝在这里是浪费你时间。 WILL：You don't know that. 你不懂。 CHUCKIE：Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left. CHUCKIE (cont'd)：Now, I don't know much. But I know that. 我告诉你我懂什么。我每天到你家接你，我们出去喝酒笑闹,那很棒。但我一天中最棒的时刻，只有十秒，从停车到你家门口，每次我敲门,都希望你不在了。不说再见,什么都没有，你就走了。 我懂得不多,但我很清楚这一点。
