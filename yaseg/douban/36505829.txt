Sometimes forbidden fruit Tastes the sweetest,doesn't it?How we draw that line.what's legal,what's illegal,Cuban cigars,alcohol.You know drink here in 1930,we're be breaking the law.Another year,we'd be okay.Who knows what will be legal next year?like pot or whatever.Maybe it's all gonna be legal next year...It does't only go one way,either.Sometimes there's stuff that's legal that shouldn't be.i mean,friggin'meth used to be legal.Used to sell it over every counter,at every pharmacy across American...
