I'm Gonna Love You Through ItBy Martina McBride She dropped the phone and burst into tearsThe doctor just confirmed her fearsHer husband held it in and held her tightCancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38With three kids who need you in their livesHe said, "I know that you’re afraid and I am, tooBut you’ll never be alone, I promise you"When you’re weak, I’ll be strongWhen you let go, I’ll hold onWhen you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyesWhen you feel lost and scared to death,Like you can’t take one more stepJust take my hand, together we can do itI’m gonna love you through it.She made it through the surgery fineThey said they caught it just in timeBut they had to take more than they plannedNow it's forced smiles and baggy shirtsTo hide what the cancer took from herBut she just wants to feel like a woman againShe said, "I don't think I can do this anymore"He took her in his arms and said "That's what my love is for"When you’re weak, I’ll be strongWhen you let go, I’ll hold onWhen you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyesWhen you feel lost and scared to death,Like you can’t take one more stepJust take my hand, together we can do itI’m gonna love you through it.And when this road gets too longI'll be the rock you lean onJust take my hand, together we can do itI’m gonna love you through it.I’m gonna love you through it.
