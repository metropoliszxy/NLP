NEVER EVER.

“Baby I know you are hurting. Right now you feel like you could never love again. Now all I ask is for a chance. To prove that I love you. From the first day. That I saw your smiling face. Honey,I knew that we would be together forever”U'll never break your heart. U'll never make you cry. U'd rather die than live without me. U'll give me all of you. YOU SAY IT TO ME ANDI BUY.
