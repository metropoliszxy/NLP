End of the exhibition

Today is the last day of the social media art exhibition,thank goodness,my disease was healed,if it didn't,I would have no idea about the quiting of the show.Professor Cui complain about the junk and rubbish thrown around in studio,what's more,everytime it generate,no one is willing to handle or solve the mess of the scene.So I could do a voluntary job:Cleaning the scene alone.To my suprise,Jone came.
