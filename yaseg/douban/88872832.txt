Trying to make ends meet , you're a slave to the money then you die. I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down... You know the one that takes you to the places where all the pain lives , yeah. No change, I can change, I can change, I can change, but I'm here in my mould , I am here in my mould. But I'm a million different people from one day to the next... I can't change my mould , no,no,no,no,no,no,no Well I never pray, But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah. I need to hear some sounds that recognise the pain in me, yeah. I let the melody shine, let it cleanze my mind , I feel free now. But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now. No change, I can change, I can change, I can change, but I'm here in my mould , I am here in my mould. And I'm a million different people from one day to the next I can't change my mould, no,no,no,no,no,no,no (Well have you ever been down?) (I can change, I can change...) Cos' it's a bittersweet symphony this life. Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die. You know I can change, I can change, I can change, but I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould. And I'm a million different people from one day to the next. I can't change my mould, no,no,no,no,no,no,no (I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down) (I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down) (It justs sex and violence melody and silence) (Been down) (Ever been down) (Ever been down) Sonnet My friend and me Looking through her red box of memories Faded I'm sure But love seems to stick in her veins you know Yes, there's love if you want it Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord Yes, there's love if you want it Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord My lord Why can't you see That nature has its way of warning me Eyes open wide Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye Yes, there's love if you want it Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord Yes, there's love if you want it Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord My lord Sinking faster than a boat without a hull My lord Dreaming about the day when I can see you there My side By my side Here we go again and my head is gone, my lord I stop to say hello 'Cause I think you should know, by now By now By now By now By now By now Oh, by now Oh, by now Oh, by now Oh, by now The Rolling People I got one more life Can you see it wasting away?
