至爱名言

Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that  gift.      或许是上帝的安排，在最终找到知音之前，我们总要遇到一些不尽如意的人，只有这样，我们才能对知音这份礼物充满感激之情。When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.      一道幸福之门关闭时，另一扇就会打开。我们经常太多太多地只看见关闭的门，而对开启的门却熟视无睹。The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever  had.      也许最好的朋友就是那些你坐在门廊下，看到的来回过往的行人。你与他们一言未语，走开时却感到好像有过最好的交谈。It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.      摘自——       无疑，一件东西只有失去时，我们才会懂得其真正的价值。同样，一件东西在得到之前，我们并没有意识到它的缺少。Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't,  be content it grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget  someone.      将爱全部付出，并不能确保一定会得到回报。别指望爱有什么回报，耐心地等待它在你所爱的人的心里生根发芽，成长壮大。即使不会那样，也要感到满足，相信爱在自己心里成长。迷恋一 个人只需要一分钟，喜欢一个人需要一个小时，爱上一个人需要一天，而忘记一个人则需要一辈子的时间。Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day  seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.      不要追求华丽的外表，外表常常具有欺骗性。不要追求万贯家产，财富也会散尽。寻找那个可以使你微笑的人，只有微笑才能使黑暗的日子变得光明。寻找那个能够使你的心灵微笑的人。
