Passion for Life

热爱生命Passion for Life汪国真by Wang Guozhen我不去想是否能够成功既然选择了远方便只顾风雨兼程我不去想能否赢得爱情既然钟情于玫瑰就勇敢地吐露真诚I care not whether I can succeed.Since in choice of the distance,I simply travel in wind and rain.I care not whether I can win love.Since in deep love with a rose,I just unbosom myself bravely.我不去想身后会不会袭来寒风冷雨既然目标是地平线留给世界的只能是背影我不去想未来是平坦还是泥泞只要热爱生命一切，都在意料之中I care not whether hit by wind and rain.Since my goal is to reach the horizon,Only my back is in face of the world.I care not whether future is smooth or muddy,If only I have passion for life,Everything will go as expected.
