奥巴马对乔布斯的悼念

 Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve was among the greatest of American innovators – brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it.By building one of the planet’s most successful companies from his garage, he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity. By making computers personal and putting the internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only accessible, but intuitive and fun. And by turning his talents to storytelling, he has brought joy to millions of children and grownups alike. Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world.The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve’s success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve’s wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him. 得知乔布斯去世的消息，我和米歇尔（Michelle）感到很难过。乔布斯是美国最伟大的创新者之一，他勇于与众不同地思考，敢于相信自己能够改变世界，并用自己的才华付诸实施。他 在自己的车库创建了世界最成功的公司之一，证明了美国独创力的精神所在。他开创了个人电脑时代并将互联网装进我们的口袋，不仅让人们感受到信息革命，还让 信息革命直观而有趣。他将自己的才华转化为讲故事，为数百万孩子和成人带来了快乐。乔布斯喜欢说自己把每天都当做最后一天来过。由于他做到了这点，所以他 改变了我们的生活、重新定义了整个行业，并铸就了人类历史上最罕见的一个奇迹：他改变了我们每个人看待世界的方式。世界失去了一位有远见的人。而对乔布斯成功最高的致敬莫过于，世界很多人是通过他发明的一个产品得知他辞世的消息的。我和米歇尔向乔布斯的妻子劳伦、乔布斯的家人以及所有爱他的人送上我们的沉思与祈祷。
