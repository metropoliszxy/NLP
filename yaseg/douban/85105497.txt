Testing Technical Summary-Test execution

Dynamical Testing:In dynamic testing the software must actually be compiled and run; Actually Dynamic Testing involves working with the software, giving input values and checking if the output is as expected. These are the Validation activities. where to use:Unit Tests, Integration Tests, System Tests and Acceptance Tests are few of the Dynamic Testing methodologies. Dynamic testing means testing based on specific test cases by execution of the test object or running programs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Statistic Testing :Static testing is a form of software testing where the software isn't actually used. This is in contrast to dynamic testing. It is generally not detailed testing, but checks mainly for the sanity of the code, algorithm, or document. It is primarily syntax checking of the code and/or manually reviewing the code or document to find errors. This type of testing can be used by the developer who wrote the code, in isolation. Code reviews, inspections and walkthroughs are also used. From the black box testing point of view, static testing involves reviewing requirements and specifications. This is done with an eye toward completeness or appropriateness for the task at hand. This is the verification portion of Verification and Validation. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Manual Testing :Manual testing is the process of manually testing software for defects. It requires a tester to play the role of an end user, and use most of all features of the application to ensure correct behavior. To ensure completeness of testing, the tester often follows a written test plan that leads them through a set of important test cases. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Automation testing :Test automation is the use of software to control the execution of tests, the comparison of actual outcomes to predicted outcomes, the setting up of test preconditions, and other test control and test reporting functions. Commonly, test automation involves automating a manual process already in place that uses a formalized testing process. where to use :It cab be used in every testing phase. It is better to begin after system is stable. 	advatages:It can improve the efficiency of test execution 	challege:1. Maintenance effort need to be considered. When UI/Implementation changes, automation script need to be updated. 2. Verification method need to be fully considered.
