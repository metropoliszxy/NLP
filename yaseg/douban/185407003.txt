心中的花

Don't go outside your house to see the flowers.My friend, don't bother with the excursion.Inside your body there are flowers.One flower has a thousand petals.That will do for a place to sit.Sitting there you will have a glimpse of beauty inside the body and out of it, before gardens and after gardens.不要到屋外去看花。我的朋友，别费事去走这趟路。在你的身体里就有很多花。一朵花有上千花瓣。可让人就坐其上。坐在那儿你将瞥见身体内外或花园前后都充满着美。
