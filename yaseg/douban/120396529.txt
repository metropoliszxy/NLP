记歌词：The Silence by Alexandra Burke

You lift me up and knock me downI'm never sure just what to feel when you're aroundI speak my heart but don't know why'Cause you don't never really say what's on your mind It's like I'm walking on broken glassI wanna know but I don't wanna ask So say you love me or say you need meDon't let the silence do the talkingJust say you want me or you don't need meDon't let the silence do the talking It's killing me the silenceIt's killing me the silenceIt's killing me the silence You let me in but then sometimesYour empty eyes just make me feel so cold insideWhen I'm with you it's like rolling diceDon't know where or how you're gonna make me crySo say you love me or say you need meDon't let the silence do the talkingJust say you want me or you don't need meDon't let the silence do the talking It's killing me the silenceIt's killing me the silenceThe silence It's like I'm walking on broken glassI wanna know but I don't wanna ask'Cause once you say it you can't take it backIf this is the end then please just make it fast So say you love me or say you need meDon't let the silence do the talkingJust say you want me or you don't need meDon't let the silence do the talking The silence the silenceThe silenceThe silence the silenceThe silence You lift me up and knock me downI'm never sure just what to feel when you're aroundlisten：
