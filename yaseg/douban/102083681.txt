Britons want William and Kate as next king and queen

Most Britons want Prince William and his new fiancee Kate Middleton to be their next king and queen, leapfrogging Prince Charles and his wife Camilla to the throne, three new polls showed Sunday.The surveys were conducted amid a wave of public support for the eldest son of Charles and his late ex-wife Diana, princess of Wales, after William announced Tuesday that he and Middleton, both 28, would marry next year.They also come after Charles, 62, suggested in an interview that Camilla might become queen when he accedes to the throne.It was announced when they married in 2005 that rather than queen Camilla, it was intended that she would use the title Princess Consort when Charles becomes king.
