3.2 Hypothesis test 2—determine whether there is significant difference of average  prices across three States among the supermarkets?Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses The null hypothesis illustrates that the ‘Basic Staple basket’ in different states is the same. μ1 for New South Wales, μ2 stands for Queensland, μ3 is Victoria.   H0: μ1=μ2=μ3Alternative hypothesis illustrates that supermarket prices across States is not same. Ha: At least one of the means is different from the others. Step 2: Determine the appropriate statistical test and sampling distributionGiven that four populations and the samples are selected randomly, the F test will be used. F=MST/MSEStep 3: Specify the Type Ⅰ error rate (α)Significance level: α=0.05Step 4: State the decision ruleBecause α=0.05, dfC=C-1=3-1=2, dfE=N-C=120-3=117;So Fcritical=F0.05, 2, 117=3.07.Decision rule: If Fobserved>3.07, reject H0; If Fobserved≤3.07, do not reject H0 Step 5: Gather sample data Step 6: Calculate the value of the test statistic Based on the data output, the observed F value is 0.11 which is smaller than the critical F value (3.07). Thus, the decision is that it cannot be rejected the null hypothesis.Step 7: State the statistical conclusion After performing the one-way ANOVA and finding  no evidence to show that there is a significant difference between the average prices across three States among the supermarkets.Step 8: Make a managerial decision Based on the data analysis, it proves that the average  prices of ‘basic staple basket’ in the supermarkets across the states are the same which will not be influenced by different size of the markets in each State, transportation costs and other costs.
