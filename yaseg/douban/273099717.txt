There goes the problem of my life. The problem of not wanting. What translates of one's existential angst to the outsider is mere immaturity. Cultivation of wealth or one's career (however significant or the opposite it might be) seems to me only an accumulation of numbers (as in numbers, from a math homework). The only way to live without the resemblance of a zombie is to love or to create. Well, the former turned out to be a one-way ticket to hell. The bleak outlook of my profession is that it's so readily replaceable, that it is pure memory game with no intellectual input required at all. It bears its good name with the mercy of a good economy inside the dominant global sphere. But with its "benefactor", aka number one trading partner going down the toilet and an aging population, let's see how much "fun" we will have in the next few years. It's a different story with MDs in which even the basic diagnosing skills require some sort of contemplation; or nurses in which to replace their physical maneuver is unimaginable. That's what I told them four years ago and they snapped......See how that turned out ha! And here I am, mixing amoxicillin suspensions so the pouty twelve-year-old who "just can't swallow pills" can clear their streps, or being instructed by phone calls of which keys to press and which adult diapers to shop is just pathetic. The problem of not wanting......All I want is to "loaf" like Larry, but even that book turned out to be one hell of a lie in the disguise of menacing naivety. Can I have an eternal life? Can I make someone decades younger? Can I be all-being and all-knowing? With these possibilities out of the question, I'm just going to lie in the bathtub, feeling I might die today. (But, no, really, I have a hunch that I will lead a long, boring life......alas the curse!) I'm the walking dead, the metaphysical Alzheimer's patient, and when I snap out of it, I wouldn't remember a thing.
