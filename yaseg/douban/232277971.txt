I SHOULD BE. AND WILL BE.

心情压抑，我想不到什么好的办法。抽了半盒烟吃了一罐鳗鱼罐头喝了三杯水，我说看《幸福来敲门》吧，有什么比得上这个电影与此时此刻的我更容易产生共鸣呢？我学会很多。1 当负面情绪泛滥的时候，要对自己大喊说：STOP IT! STOP IT! DID U HEAR ME! STOP IT! 2 当觉得长路漫漫，艰难险阻无尽头之时，可以唱那首：LORD, DON'T MOVE THE MOUNTAINS. LORD, GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO CLIMB IT. 3 当想要放弃，很多人叫你放弃的时候，记住：DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL U WHAT U CAN'T DO. IF U WANT TO DO SOMETHING, DO IT. THAT IS UR DREAM. U GONNA PROTECT IT. 4 再苦再累，我想自己也比不过chris的万分之一，尽管我不是男人，但也自称爷们许多年。我有什么理由自怨自艾呢？HAPPINESS. HAPPINESS. HAPPINESS. 这是我想要的，我会努力得到。I SHOULD BE A WRITER, A TRAVELER AND A VISIONARY. I WILL BE IT.
