My Life as YY

The first day I saw her, for slip injuries, Marg noticed my acne. She asked if I had been taking medicine for it at all. The answer was of course negative. Then she asked if I was on birth control (She later explained sometimes the pills help)  "No."  "You have sex?" "No!" "Not ever?" "...No" She smiled and winked at me " I'm not your mom." (Well, I know I suck but I am telling the truth...And if I ever have sex, my mom would be the first one to know. Actually...third. You know why...)The end of the appointment, she prescribed me IC Doxycycline. The second one, she gave me three condoms after saying" Well let me know if you have sex and we'll get you on birth control." Gee... Thanks a lot, MOM. I was actually here for a referral for X-ray! But Marg was right. I am fine. I fell. It hurts, for sure. I'm even doing better than she is in terms of moving arms and turing wristsï¼ˆjkd). She's an old lady. Probably in her late sixties. And I can tell she's an experienced physician. I gave up my last thought of getting the referral when she said " I don't want to expose you to radiation you know." Yeah so that's my story with the school health center. I walked out with three condoms and Marg's expectation of me finally having sex someday, while my boyfriend is far far away on the other side of the earth...
