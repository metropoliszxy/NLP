"Gothic and Lolita clothing are a maiden's armor, which even a knight's armor cannot compare to. A maiden's lace is her steel. Her ribbons are chains. Her dress hat is her helmet, and she surreptitiously changes the blood that flows from her wounds into true rose petals. Thus, the maiden fights. After all, to live is to fight, and to become beautiful is to become stronger." - from "Oh Maiden, Advance with a Sword and a Rose" by Arika Takarano
