I said, "To greet you, O Lord." 祂说：「谁在我的门口？」我说：「祢的谦卑的仆人。」祂说：「你有什么事？」我说：「前来问候祢，我的主啊。」He said, "How long will you journey on?" I said, "Until you stop me." He said, "How long will you boil in the fire?" I said, "Until I am pure. 祂说：「你还要旅行多久？」我说：「直到祢叫我停下。」祂说：「你要在火里滚多久？」我说：「直到我纯净。」"This is my oath of love. For the sake of love I gave up wealth and position." 「这是我爱的誓言。为了爱我放弃健康与地位。」He said, "You have pleaded your case but you have no witness."

I said, "By the splendor of your justice my eyes are clear and faultless." 祂说：「你已经为你的案子做出答辩，但你没有证人。」我说：「我的泪水就是我的证人；我练上的苍白就是我的证明。」祂说：「你的证人没有可信度；你的双眼太湿而看不清楚。」我说：「由于祢的正义光辉我的双眼清晰无暇。」He said, "What do you seek?" I said, "To have you as my constant friend." He said, "What do you want from me?" I said, "Your abundant grace." 祂说：「你要找什么？」我说：「拥有祢这永远的朋友。」祂说：「你想从我这里得到什么？」我说：「祢丰富的慈悲。」
