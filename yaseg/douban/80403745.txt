The Rose

昨天很巧又听到了这首歌，去搜了一下才知道原来有那么多的版本。一首歌因为某些事情，就有了特殊的意义，就让它留在心底吧，永远为恩克祝福，为德国队祝福！LeAnn Rimes - The rose Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reedSome say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleedSome say love, it is a hungeran endless aching needI say love is a flowerAnd you, it's only seedIt's the heart afraid of breakingthat never learns to danceIt's the dream afraid of wakingthat never takes the chanceIt's the one who won't be taken who can not seem to giveAnd the soul afraid of dying that never learns to liveWhen the night has been too lonelyAnd the road has been too longAnd you think that love is only for thelucky and the strongJust remember in the winterFar beneath the bitter snow lies the seed That with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose
