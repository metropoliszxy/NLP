smoke gets in your eyes

They asked me how I knew my true love was trueI of course repliedsomething here inside cannot be denied.They said "someday you'll find all who love are blind."When your heart's on fire,you must realize smoke gets in your eyesSo I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love.Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love.Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hideSo I smile and say"when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes!"
