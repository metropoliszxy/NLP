Although Parisian Views was published in 1997, only one book in her notes or bibli-ography was published as recently as 1995 and but a few from 1994. Rice missed sev-eral works that would have been directly useful:Anthony Sutcliffe’s Paris: An Architec-tural History (New York, 1993), David Van Zanten’s Building Paris: ArchitecturalInstitutions and the Transformation of the French Capital, 1830–1870 (Cambridge,1994), Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson’s Paris as Revolution: Writing the Nineteenth-century City (Berkeley, Calif., 1994), and my own Transforming Paris: The Life andLabors of Baron Haussmann (New York, 1995). All or some of these might have modi-ﬁed or tempered her view of Haussmann’s work.
