美学的一些摘录

Bernard Leach felt a divide had been unnaturally created between the different aspects of human nature - the heart the head and the hand ( the spirit, the mind and the body) and that art was a means of bridging this divide. 英国艺术评论家John Ruskin关于不完美的认识：Never demand an exact finish for its own sake, but only for some practical or noble end. . . . the demand for perfection is always a sign of a misunderstanding of the ends of art. . . . Imperfection is in some sort essential to all we know of life. It is the sign of life in a mortal body. . . . To banish imperfection is to destroy expression, to check exertion, to paralyze vitality. All things are literally better, lovelier, and more beloved for the imperfections which have been divinely appointed.虽说是讲美，但也可以运用到人的身上吧。太完美的人，让人觉得飘在空气里，不真实。那些不完美的，才让人爱，觉得有血有肉！哈哈
