The Oriental Pearl Tower is the penis of Shanghai

         As the landmark of Shnghai, the Oriental Pearl Tower is an scenic  spot that has attracted tourists all over the world. It has become a symbol of this vibrant international city since the first day it was built. “You can touch the pulse of  Shanghai and even China when you watch it.” Standing on  the beautiful Bund at night, watching the Oriental Pearl Tower right across the Huangpu River, I seemed to wind up my whole southern trip with a perfect conclude.           I tried to appreciate the Tower like other tourists on the Bund, however, a whim came to my mind: The Oriental Pearl is the penis of Shanghai. To be honest, I was shocked by myself for a moment, then I was kind of proud of my observation and imagination.    The reasons are as follows:    The shape of the Tower resembles IT with a long ,straight main construction and two balls.    Every tourist can come to it. The Shanghai trip can’t possibly a complete one without having a look at the Tower, because that’s the climax of the whole traveling.    The rapid growth of this city wins a lot of wows and whees frome home and abroad.“Amazing!” was the most common word that I heard that night on the Bund. As proud as a peacock, the Tower stands up straight on the Bund, waiting for tourists all over the world to see it.
