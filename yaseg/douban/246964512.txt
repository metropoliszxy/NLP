Greateat Bastard-Damien Rice

GREATEST BASTARDI made you laugh, I made you cry I made you open up your eyes. Didn't i?I helped you open out your wings Your legs and many other things. Didn't I?Am I the greatest bastard that you know? The only one who let you go? The one you hurt so much you cannot bear...Well, we were good when we were good When we were not misunderstood.You helped me love, you helped me live. You helped me learn how to forgive. Didn't you?I wish that I could say the same But when you left, you left the blame. Didn't you?Am I the greatest bastard that you met? The only one you can forget Am I the one your truth's been waiting for?Or am I just dreaming once again? Some dreams are better in the end.I just woke in bed And you were in my head. I was underground And in a dream, Past this place I'm not supposed to be And you were there waiting for me. And with a smile you said: "It's been a while" You asked if I had seen her recently.Am I the greatest bastard that you know? When will we learn to let this go? We've fought so much we've broken all the charts. But letting go is not the same As pushing someone else away.So please don't let on you don't know me. Please don't let on that I'm not here. Please don't let on you don't love me: 'Cause I know you do. I know you do. Somewhere.
