While my guitar gently weeps - George Harrison

I look at you all see the love there that's sleepingWhile my guitar gently weepsI look at the floor and I see it needs sweepingStill my guitar gently weeps.I don't know why nobody told youHow to unfold your loveI don't know how someone controlled youThey bought and sold you.I look at the world and I notice it's turningWhile my guitar gently weepsWith every mistake we must surely be learningStill my guitar gently weeps.I don't know how you were divertedYou were perverted tooI don't know how you were invertedNo one alerted you.I look at you all see the love there that's sleepingWhile my guitar gently weepsLook at you all...Still my guitar gently weeps.--->
