TCP slow start

TCP Receive WindowTCP Receive Window is the amount of data that a computer can accept without acknowledging the sender. If sender has not received acknowledgement for the first packet it sent, it will stop and wait and if this wait exceeds a certain limit, it may even retransmit. This is how TCP achieves reliable data transfer.Even if there is no packet loss in the network, windowing can limit throughput. Because TCP transmits data up to the window size before waiting for the packets, the full bandwidth of the network may not always get used.TCP slow startTCP slow start algorithm is part of the congestion control in TCP, designed to avoid sending more data than the network is capable of transmitting.Slow-start algorithm works by increasing the TCP Window by one segment for each acknowledged segment. This behavior effectively doubles the TCP Window size each round trip of the network.The algorithm continues increasing until this "congestion window" (cwnd) reaches the size of the receivers advertised TCP Receive Window (RWIN), or until packet loss occurs.Fast recoveryThere is a variation to the slow-start algorithm known as fast recovery. In the fast recovery algorithm, during congestion avoidance mode, when packets (detected through 3 duplicate ACKs) are not received, the congestion window size is reduced to half it's size (slow-start treshold) rather than the much smaller initial value.But Windows Vista introduces a number of new features to the TCP/IP stack, including CTCP, and TCP Window Auto-Tuning. Compound TCP The traditional slow-start and congestion avoidance algorithms in TCP help avoid network congestion by gradually increasing the TCP window at the beginning of transfers until the TCP Receive Window boundary is reached, or packet loss occurs. For broadband internet connections that combine high TCP Window with higher latency (high BDP), these algorithms do not increase the TCP windows fast enough to fully utilize the bandwidth of the connection.Compound TCP (CTCP) increases the TCP send window more aggressively for broadband connections (with large RWIN and BDP).Turning this option on can significantly increase throughput.
