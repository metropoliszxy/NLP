On my way to being a scientist by Thomas M. Schofield

A scientific paper is just one cut and polished facet of a bigger, uglier stone. Behind the beautiful graphs and whip-smart arguments lies a tangled mass of doubts, conjectures and anomalies. Pulling any loose thread is usually enough to make the paper lose its shape. The most important thing mysupervisor taught me was that this is not a bad thing.Some scientists are lucky enough to pass through a fourth stage. This is when you realize that science is not about finding the truth at all, but about finding better ways of being wrong. The best scientific theory is not the one that reveals the truth â€” that is impossible. It is the one that explains what we already know about the world in the simplest way possible, and that makes useful predictionsabout the future.Source:
