disaster

We just recovered from flooding, earthquake in Newzealand comes. We just stop talking about earthquake in Newzealand, cyclone comes. Devastation is everywhere. We just forget, alternatively,try to forget disaster, Tsunami happened in Japan, bringing devastating earthquake of 8.8 magnet, flooding and shocks. Warning spread along pacific island sooner. Is that means 2012 will come in the end?
