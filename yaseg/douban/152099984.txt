I always think that I should've done something crazy in my life, like drug abusing, having sex with lots of people, committing suicide, living with a bunch of homeless people in somewhere I completely don't know or marrying to some guy I just met for a couple of days and forgetting about all the responsbility and stuff... But I never did any of them. This is amazing.
