+ Paige: I vow to help you love life, to always hold you with tenderness, and to have the patience that love demands. To speak when words are needed, and to share the silence when theyâ€™re not. To agree to disagree on red velvet cake, and to live within the warmth of your heart and always call it home.Leo: I vow to fiercely love you in all your forms, now and forever. I promise to never forget that this is a once in a lifetime love. I vow to love you, and no matter what challenges might carry us apart, we will always find a way back to each other.+ I chose to stay with him for all the things he's done right; not the one thing he's done wrong. I chose to forgive him. -Rita Thornton
