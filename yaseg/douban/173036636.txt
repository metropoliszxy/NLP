Tears In Heaven

Â Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would you be the same If I saw you in heaven? I must be strong and carry on, Because I know I don t belong here in heaven. Would you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven? Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven? I ll find my way through night and day, Because I know I just can t stand here in heaven. Time can bring you down, Time can bend your knees, Time can break your heart. Have you begging please, Beyond the door there s peace I m sure Begging please. And I know there ll be no more tears in heaven. Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would you be the same If I saw you in heaven? I must be strong and carry on, Because I know I don t belong here in heaven.
