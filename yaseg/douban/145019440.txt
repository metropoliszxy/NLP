The Tiffany's

Holly Golightly: You know those days when you get the mean reds?Paul Varjak: The mean reds, you mean like the blues?Holly Golightly: No. The blues are because you're getting fat and maybe it's been raining too long, you're just sad that's all. The mean reds are horrible. Suddenly you're afraid and you don't know what you're afraid of. Do you ever get that feeling?Paul Varjak: Sure.Holly Golightly: Well, when I get it the only thing that does any good is to jump in a cab and go to Tiffany's. Calms me down right away. The quietness and the proud look of it; nothing very bad could happen to you there. If I could find a real-life place that'd make me feel like Tiffany's, then - then I'd buy some furniture and give the cat a name!霍莉：你曾有心绪不宁的时候吗？韦保罗：你是说情绪忧郁？霍莉：不是。人胖了或下雨了，人才会忧虑伤感。但心绪不宁更可怕，你突然害怕而不知为何。你有过这种感觉吗？韦保罗：当然。霍莉：每当我心绪不宁时，我便乘计程车到蒂凡尼去。它能令我即时心安下来。它那么宁静和高贵，那儿不会发生什么不幸的事。若我能在现实生活中找到像蒂法尼那样的地方，那么，那么我会买点家具，替猫咪取个名字！
