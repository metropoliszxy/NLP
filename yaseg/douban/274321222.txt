异曲同工

这学期的英国文学课接近尾声，很是意犹未尽。刚刚读了两首诗，惊喜地发现其主旨和最近几年广大青少年的某些喜好甚是合拍。---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you're anxious for to shine in the high aesthetic line,as a man of culture rare,You must get up all the germs of the transcendental terms,and plant them everywhere.You must lie upon the daisies and discourse in novel phrases of your complicated state of mind, The meaning doesn't matter if it's only idle chatterof a transcendental kind. And everyone will say, As you walk your mystic way, "If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me,Why, what a very singularly deep young manthis deep young man must be!"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I fell a-weeping, and I cried, 'Sweet youth,Tell me why, sad and sighing, thou dost roveThese pleasant realms? I pray thee speak me soothWhat is thy name?' He said, 'My name is Love.'Then straight the first did turn himself to meAnd cried, 'He lieth, for his name is Shame,But I am Love, and I was wont to beAlone in this fair garden, till he cameUnasked by night; I am true Love, I fillThe hearts of boy and girl with mutual flame.'Then sighing, said the other, 'Have thy will,I am the love that dare not speak its name.'p.s. 原来第二首诗的作者是王尔德的基友和导致他入狱的元凶。
