New Year is Coming

 Since this might be the last new year I can ever have, It's nice to make it special, make it shine, But how could I ? the Answer is Blowing in the Air ...  I was on the toilet smoking and then Boom I thought I was happy when everyone caresAnd I almost become miserable while I'm playing with myself just like that  I remember the talks about how to built a good life and manage it keep on the track with every next generation , yet I can rarely communicate with my family members either I had a serious communicating problem because of me being the new-generation or I got it from my family tree the way they communicate is rather different from us nowadays people Well of course, because we are the new generation , think , what will it be when we taking the control , haha , a little bit crazy , but I promise we'll be the best governors ever in all ways Cuz the tip for today and tomorrow is lying there You just have to feel it And when you can not , just worry as if it is going to help you Lol  back to topicI was tryin to write some shit when it hit me in the toilet with these ideas it says:Everyone does have super powers only when they can feel it and keep feeling it till you get something done  In this theory I am going to rasie just one fect and that is Think about your family tree Think about your root When you found something special that you think your family tree your root deep and down thereWill proud of you if you can make it work again and enable your whole system ready to download the super powers and devide to anyone who feels it  Bullshit ! but keep typing Super Power 1 one connecting with the whole (that means what ever you need as a human being needed so you must get it for the sake of being the whole ) racism is an example of overused the power by being expand oneself to his race level so he can disagree with the other race And we have too many stories to tell but let's just skip it over and pretending we feeling the experience which we can never feel until we actually go through it  Never the less You do have those powers to change your whole life by being yourself but you will have to respond for that So let us pray as if it's working and you and I become better than ever Super Power 2 Get one major thing done in one life time (look at the great people in histroy)Super Power 3  Combine the different elements and make it into one purpose (the power of focus on one thing and manage the others in their own ways )Super Power 4  Endless Creativeness (am i talking too much , because I always have a problem with No.4 that made me believe if I can keep flowing for a long time some great thing may occur)sometimes bullshit occur I mean shit happens right ?to be continue
