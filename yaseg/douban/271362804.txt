While my guitar gently weeps

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 我看着你沉睡的爱情While my guitar gently weeps 我的吉他呜咽I look at the floor and I see it need sweeping 我看着地一片的狼藉 Still my guitar gently weeps 我的琴声呜咽I don't know why nobody told you 我不知为何无人告诉你 how to unfold your love 怎样敞开心扉I don't know how someone controlled you 我不知为何他们控制你they bought and sold you 任你变卖流离I look at the world and I notice it's turning 我看这世界瞬息万变While my guitar gently weeps 我的吉他呜咽With every mistake we must surely be learning 从每个错误吸取教训Still my guitar gently weeps 我的琴声呜咽I don't know how you were diverted 我不知如何你变了心意you were perverted too 还自甘堕落 I don't know how you were inverted 我不知如何你改变自己no one alerted you 无人警告你I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 我看着你沉睡的爱情 While my guitar gently weeps 我的吉他呜咽I look at you all 我看着你Still my guitar gently weeps  我的琴声呜咽 ( I look from the wings at the play you are staging 我注视自舞台边你光华四射 While my guitar gently weeps 我的吉他呜咽As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging 我静坐时光飞逝任年华老去 Still my guitar gently weeps 我的琴声呜咽视频在这儿：
