Plain White T's: Broken Record LyricsSongwriters: Higgenson, Thomas John; Maloy, Zachary David; Tompkins, Christopher;It was summer love, She was like a drug, Bit me like a club, Everything was alright, I was James Dean, She was Billie Jean, California Queen, Everything was alright, From the bad beat, To the back scene, In the heat heat, Everything was alright, [Pre-Chorus:]Lovers and gears of common bomb, She'll always be my favorite songShe was silent gold, She was Rock'n'rollI should have never let her go go go[Chorus:]Kiss me goodbye and I knew it was final, Got in her daddy's car and she was gone like vinyl, Her memory pops up when I least expect it, It's stuck in my head like a broken record, Pa pa pa pa pa Broken Record, P-p-pa pa pa Broken record, A broke, a broke, a broken record, P-p-pa pa pa Broken record, She was hot file, She was low file, Burning up July, Everything was alright, Let me with a kiss, I wonder where she is, If that she ever miss me, Oh oh oh, [Pre-Chorus][Chorus][Bridge:]I wished I could find her, Ooh oh oh, Cause I need to remind her, Ooh oh oh, [Chorus][Outro:]Skip skip through my head, Skip skip through my head, Skip skip skip through my head all day.
