With Him

Babyface   <With Him>So ya never meant to hurt nobodyWell I think your full of it'Cause if ya realy really didn't wanna hurt nobody You wouldn't slept with my best friendAnd I bring insult to my injuryYou weren't a bit discreteAnd while the world stood witnessTo my embarrassmentYou put a knife inside of meChorus:How could you fall in love with himHow could you give your heart to himThought we'd grow oldAs loversTogether til' the endHow could you fall fall in love with himNow I know we've had our, up and downsAnd that I do admitBut sometimes lovers go astrayBut you've made it permanentOh I can't be there understandingMy heart's just not that big ( no it ain't, no it ain't)And I can take the painOf infidelityBut I can't take you with himChorusThought we'd grow oldAs loversTogether til' the endHow could you fallFall in love with him
