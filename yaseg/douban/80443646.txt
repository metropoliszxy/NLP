How I long for the deep sleep dreaming.I stay inside this dream never come backI don't have to face the shinning, bright lightIt is too yellow and redI just want to stay in blue with you, the only person who knows me so wellIt is not the ocean We will never know how deep it isWhisper to me Tell me, what are we going to doYou knowThe next step
