I Love This Song

I walk this road alone was the English version of the famous Nothing to My Name, sung by Chinese godfather Cuijian.I just love this song, listening to it again and again. The simple English lyrics is a highlight to it, just like another song of theirs-Take Me to Your Heart, which is also a remake of a classic Chinese song, Goodbye Kiss by Hong Kong singer Jacky Cheung.I heard Take Me to Your Heart before, but this is the first time that I notice the band’s name. I should say it has really odd name. I don’t think I will forget the name once I know itI recommend the song to a classmate. To my disappointment, she tells me that it creeps her out because she keeps recalling the original Chinese version.Anyway, I’m glad that I haven’t waste any time and finish my English resume. The next step is to put it on the FESCO website, hoping that may help me find a job.
