Viva la Vida 沃勒割去的生活 I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own 遥想当年，哥主宰世界 翻江倒海，放个p的事情 现在，哥独自无眠到天亮 寂寞无助扫大街。。 I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listen as the crowd would sing: "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!" 遥想当年，哥盾墙破釜 扛着boss不带颤 沐浴山呼： 苍天已死，黄天当道 One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 曾几何时，哥刚搞清钥匙是哪只 怎料转身插错门 苦心经营几十年 一朝回到解放前 I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you go there was never, never an honest word That was when I ruled the world 哥听到了耶路撒冷和尚在念经 罗马骑兵文工团在呻吟 你们是哥的照妖镜，你们是哥的折戟龙鳞 哥远去的勇士们啊 是因为不能说的秘密 自从你们离去 再也没有人对哥真心 这就是当年，哥当扛霸子的事情 It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become YD的妖风啊 吹开门帘放我进 砸碎玻璃翻窗户，敲锣打鼓把哥迎 哥跟你说你都不信 Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king? 城管等着银盘红烧狮子头 哥可怜兮兮只当腰带做头绳 啊西巴，谁想做老大一当好多年？ I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world 哥听到了耶路撒冷和尚在念经 罗马骑兵文工团在呻吟 你们是哥的照妖镜，你们是哥的折戟龙鳞 哥远去的勇士们啊 是因为不能说的秘密 我知道Peter三不会再call我 自从你们离去 再也没有真心 这就是当年，哥当扛霸子的事情
