眼处心生句自神

20110218马上打算去听 Nobert Schwartz 的学院讲席讲座，顺手复习了一下我最爱的 PE Converse，看到一个好句子，不抄一下不足以平民愤： It seems clear that, however logically coherent a belief system may seem to the holder, the sources of constraint are much less logical in the classical sense than they are psychological--and less psychological than social. 顺便提一下，我还以为 Schwartz 早就拿到讲席了。
