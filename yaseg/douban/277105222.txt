A Korean plastic surgery addict injected cooking oil into her face

A plastic surgery addict injected cooking oil into her face when doctors refused to give her any more silicone.Former model Hang Mioku has been left permanently disfigured following the DIY beauty treatment.After injecting an entire bottle of black market silicone into her face, Hang resorted to using cooking oil that left her face severely swollen and scarred.Her plights was featured on Korean television and viewers donated thousands of pounds to pay for corrective surgery.During the first of 10 operations, surgeons removed 60g of silicone, oil and other foreign substances from her face and 200g from her neck.However, Hang is still disfigured and she said she wishes she could have her old face back.Hang had her first procedure aged 28 and then moved to Japan where she had repeated treatments. She quickly became obsessed with having smoother and softer skin.Doctors eventually refused to carry out any more work on her after her face became noticeably enlarged.However, she managed to get hold of a bottle of silicone and a syringe to self-inject but when that ran out she resorted to use cooking oil.Her face was so altered that her own parents did not recognise her and local children also used to call her 'standing fan' because her face was so large compared to her small body.Numerous operations paid for by donations have managed to reduce the size of her face and neck but she is still significantly disfigured.via: 新浪教育译文重点词（10）noticeably['nəutisəbli]adv. 显著地，明显地；引人注目地silicone['silikəun]n. 硅树脂；[口腔] 硅酮inject[in'dʒekt]vt. 注入；注射significantly[sig'nifəkəntli]adv. 意味深长地；值得注目地plight[plait]n. 困境；境况；誓约 vt. 保证；约定substance['sʌbstəns]n. 物质；实质；资产；主旨addict[ə'dikt]n. 有瘾的人；入迷的人 vt. 使上瘾；使沉溺donate[dəu'neit, 'dəu-]vt. 捐赠；捐献 vi. 捐赠；捐献 n. 捐赠；捐献donation[dəu'neiʃən]n. 捐款，捐赠物；捐赠obsess[ɔb'ses]vt. 迷住，缠住；使…着迷；使…困扰
