I DO

All I am, all I'll beEverything in this worldAll that I'll ever needIs in your eyesShining at meWhen you smile I can feelAll my passion unfoldingYour hand brushes mineAnd a thousand sensationsSeduce me 'cause IChorusI do cherish youFor the rest of my lifeYou don't have to think twiceI will love you still>From the depths of my soulIt's beyond my controlI've waited so long to say this to youIf you're asking do I love you this muchI doIn my world, before youI lived outside my emotionsDidn't know where I was going'Till that day I found youHow you opened my lifeTo a new paradiseIn a world torn by changeStill with all my heart'Till my dying day等你唱给我听
