Testing Technical Summary-Test level

Unit Testing :Unit testing refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, usually at the function level. In an object-oriented environment, this is usually at the class level, and the minimal unit tests include the constructors and destructors. Usually done by developer where to use:Daily verify code changes before check in code by developer 	challenge:1. Find bug as early as possible. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Integration Testing :Software testing that seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design. Software components may be integrated in an iterative way or all together -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------System Testing:Completely integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Regression Testing 	It focus on finding defects after a major code change has occurred.challenge:Test case should be selected to verify bug fixing and related feature. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Acceptance Testing :Acceptance testing can mean one of two things:   1. A smoke test is used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a new build to the main testing process, i.e. before integration or regression.  2. Acceptance testing performed by the customer, often in their lab environment on their own HW, is known as user acceptance testing (UAT). Known as alpha testing and beta testing. 	Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers' site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta testing. Beta testing comes after alpha testing. Versions of the software, known as beta versions, are released to a limited audience outside of the programming team. The software is released to groups of people so that further testing can ensure the product has few faults or bugs. Sometimes, beta versions are made available to the open public to increase the feedback field to a maximal number of future users.
