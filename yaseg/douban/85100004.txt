Testing Technical Summary-Non-functional testing

Internationalization and localization Testing :Internationalization and localization is needed to test these aspects of software. It will verify that the application still works, even after it has been translated into a new language or adapted for a new culture (such as different currencies or time zones). where to use:Software will be released in different domain/country. Which can make the user interface friendly for all users. 	challenge :Depend on the software release area. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Usability Testing:Usability testing is needed to check if the user interface is easy to use and understand. where to use:Integration testing, function and non-functional testing, Test for tutorial and sample code. 	challenge:Need consider disables if need. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance Testing :software performance testing is used to determine the speed or effectiveness of a computer, network, software program or device. where to use:This process can involve quantitative tests done in a lab, such as measuring the response time or the number of MIPS (millions of instructions per second) at which a system functions. Qualitative attributes such as reliability, scalability and interoperability may also be evaluated. Performance testing is often done in conjunction with stress testing. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Stability(load) Testing :Stability testing checks to see if the software can continuously function well in or above an acceptable period. This activity of Non Functional Software Testing is oftentimes referred to as load (or endurance) testing. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Security Testing :Security testing is essential for software that processes confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers. 	where to use:It need to be considered in every testing phase. Negative testing and boundary testing need to be considered to achieve goal .
