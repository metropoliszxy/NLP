she's the one  i was her she was me  we were one we were free  and if there's somebody  calling me on  she's the one  we were young  we were wrong  we were fine all along  if there's somebody  calling me on  she's the one  when you get to  where you wanna go  and you know the things  you wanna know  you're smiling  when you said what you wanna say  and you know the way you wanna play  you'll be so high you'll be flying  though the sea will be strong  i know we'll carry on  cos if there's somebody calling me on  she's the one
