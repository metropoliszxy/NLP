Joe

There was a time I was so lonelyRemember the time, it was a fridayYou made me feel fine, we did it my wayI sat on your knees every fridayI still recall you...I see you in summer...Joe... joe...I sat on your chair by the fireTransfixed in a stare, taking me higherPrecious years to rememberChildhood fears I surrenderI still recall you...I see you in summer...Joe... joe...Cranberries - Joe
