Mac Cosmeticsï¼šYoung people to use cosmetics, what the advantages and disadvantages?

There are reasons they use to maintain because they spend most of what? That more points ~ ps: just answered your own point of view or only one question it does not matter oh Since it is autumn, the weather is dry. So this time, young people appropriate to use some moisturizing, hydrating cosmetics category, can increase the skin's moisture and prevent drying of the climate damage caused to the skin. But the more tender young skin, so choose the brand must be careful, otherwise they will play the opposite effect. On the other hand it, early use of cosmetics, skin will become dependent, the longer requirements for cosmetics will be higher. What if the make-up, I personally do not recommend too early to reach young people because the skin will cause some damage. Adolescence is a natural, natural is best. Benefits: beautiful Cons: destroy the already delicate skin Use of reason: that their adult, beauty, learning with others May I ask what is "reason to maintain their spending?" Also, be sure to distinguish between skin care products and cosmetics. . . .
