The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

The any real failure is the failure to try. And the measure of success is how we cope with disappointment. As we always must. We came here, and we tried. All of us in our different ways. Can we be blamed for feeling that we are too old to change? Too scared of disappointment to start it all again? We get up in the morning. We do our best. Nothing else matters. But it's also true that the person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing. All we know about the future is that it will be different. But perhaps what we fear is that it will be the same. So we must celebrate the changes. Because as someone once said, everything will be better in the end, and if it's not all right, then trust me, it's not yet the end.
