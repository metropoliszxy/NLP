Your Feet Deserve It

Ladies, wear your comfortable heels out with your perfect gentlemen during this romantic fall.“Sex and the City” didn’t only teach us the secrets behind relationships and men, but also the necessity of countless pairs of heels. No one doubts that high heels are the symbol of sexy and feminine. However, women tend to face an ultimatum: look comfortable and cute with flats or hold back tears of pain and like hot with heels. I have good news. Those are not your only two options! Thanks to some genius designers (and some cheaper options), there are ways for us to look sexy and feel like we’re walking on Cloud 9.First let’s go over our most expensive options, and work our way down to reality. ■Christian Louboutin Red soles anyone? One of the world’s most famous designers, Christian Louboutin, always strives to create the ideal high heels. He stands by his statement that shoes should be like jewels. Louboutin’s remarkable red glossy soles empower heels and gives a signature of fashion excellence.  Every fashionista is addicted to the classic open-toe pumps, patent elegant 7 inch high heels and unique lace booties. Each pair of the high heels demonstrates how sky-high shoes can be the most comfortable high heels for the perfect lady.The only problem is that you’re sure to be spending top dollar. Be sure to check out Bluefly for discounts if you’re ready to hand over the big bucks.■Jimmy ChooCourtesy of mabelandzora.comCompared to Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo’s high heels are considered to be the sexiest high heels in the world.The signature arc curve on both sides of the heels is their trademark secret to sexy. Jimmy Choo also provides various mid-to-high pumps and sandals, or even wedges and flats. You’re bound to find something to adore if you have some extra money to treat yourself.Colors range from basic black to sparkling or flower printed. There’s really something for everybody. What’s comfortable for one foot simply might not be comfortable for the next–so this give you the choice to find your perfect fit. Some of the evening high heels even boast adorable pearls on the front. Jimmy Choo is definitely a must-have staple for your fabulous wardrobe; even if it’s just one gorgeous pair. Check out ShopStyle for some prices, but they are certainly not for the faint of heart. ■Realistic OptionsAll right, all right. I know what you’re thinking. “Does this girl really think I can afford these heels?” This was just some candy to drool over; or some fodder for the fire when you’re daydreaming about being rich and living the “Devil Wears Prada” life.Don’t worry. There are heels for us to.            If you’re in need of some cute heels for a cute price, check out Urban Original, a personal favorite. They offer a wide array of shoes ranging from about $20-$40–and you really can’t beat that. Even ShoeOcean will give you some really great deals. A word of advice: When choosing your heel, remember that these are not going to last as long as a pair of Jimmy Choo’s shoes. They’re made from cheaper material, and will tend to deteriorate faster (especially if you’re having a crazy night). Make sure to look for materials that will not easily scratch off, and opt for materials that are more like suede (just don’t wear them on a rainy night!) And, if you’re looking to optimize comfort, I can’t emphasize this enough: opt for straps! Pumps with straps around the ankle are going to provide more support. Keep that in mind!
