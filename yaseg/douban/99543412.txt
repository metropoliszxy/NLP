3 Hypothesis Test Analysis3.1 Hypothesis test 1—determine whether there is no significant difference of the average  prices for the Basic Staple basket at different supermarkets.a) Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses The null hypothesis illustrates that the entire price for ‘Basic Staple basket’ in different supermarkets is the same. μ1 refers to Coles/BI-LO, μ2 refers to Woolworths/Safeway, μ3 refers to Independents, and μ4 refers to ALDI.    H0: μ1=μ2=μ3=μ4Alternative hypothesis illustrates that not all the price for ‘Basic Staple basket’ in different supermarkets is same Ha: One of the means is different from the others at least. Step 2: Determine the appropriate statistical test and sampling distributionGiven that four populations and the samples are selected randomly, the F test will be used. F=MST/MSEStep 3: Specify the Type Ⅰ error rate (α)Significance level: α=0.05Step 4: State the decision rule  Step 5: Gather sample data Step 6: Calculate the value of the test statistic of From the data output, it shows that F value is 506.67 greater than the critical F value (2.68). Thus, the decision is to reject the null hypothesis.Step 7: State the statistical conclusion After performing the one-way ANOVA and finding a significant difference in mean price for ‘basic staple basket’ in different supermarkets. Step 8: Make a managerial decision Based on the data analysis, it proves that there are significant differences in the average prices of ‘basic staple basket’ in diverse supermarkets. Therefore, hypothesis test 1 is rejected.b) Findings: From the data analysis, it shows that there is a  difference of average prices in these supermarkets. Nevertheless, the difference between the price of ‘basic staple basket’ in large buying power supermarkets and that in other supermarkets cannot be described in details.
