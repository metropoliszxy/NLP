when you are gone

I always needed time on my ownI never thought I'd need you there when I cryAnd the days feel like years when I'm aloneAnd the bed where you lie is made up on your sideWhen you walk away I count the steps that you takeDo you see how much I need you right now?When you're goneThe pieces of my heart are missing youWhen you're goneThe face I came to know is missing tooWhen you're goneThe words I need to hear to always get me throughThe day and make it okI miss youI've never felt this way beforeEverything that I do reminds me of youAnd the clothes you left, they lie on the floorAnd they smell just like you, I love the things that you doWhen you walk away I count the steps that you takeDo you see how much I need you right now?When you're goneThe pieces of my heart are missing youAnd when you're goneThe face I came to know is missing tooAnd when you're goneThe words I need to hear to always get me throughThe day and make it okI miss youWe were made for each otherOut here foreverI know we were, yeahAnd all I ever wanted was for you to knowEverything I'd do, I'd give my heart and soulI can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me, yeahWhen you're goneThe pieces of my heart are missing youAnd when you're goneThe face I came to know is missing tooAnd when you're goneAll the words I need to hear will always get me throughThe day and make it okI miss you
