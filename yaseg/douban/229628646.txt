live in the now

whatever you do, your fate keeps watching you and heeding you. and it's been a great morning, for a deep breath of ease and a clear mind that follows. sigh. when is the last time i realized life could be reinvigorated? long ago. probably when i was not realizing it when i was actually making use of it. then, then i lost the ability. perhaps on that day i started to have an ambition. seems the old tempo is back. to stay productive next few weeks and carry it through to the end of the life? not bad.
