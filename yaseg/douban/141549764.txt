Barefoot Running in 2001 rage began Jordan Shoes

There are many , running advocates out there. When Australian 2:42 marathoner Michael Warburton wrote an article called "Barefoot Running" in 2001,, the rage began . His argument was based on the fact that the extra weight of the shoes could slow you down. In addition, many Olympic gold medalists in the marathon have come from countries where running barefoot is how they trained.An argument says that when you put an artificial shoe on a foot that already is designed to endure most activities, you are manipulating the system  that you are somehow interfering with the proprioceptive abilities you have.In other words, when you put on socks and shoes, your body's ability to measure and gauge the environment, forces and various stresses is diminished . So if our ancestors ran around hunting and gathering in bare feet or very thin, moccasins, does this change the need for shoes now? Yes!相关的主题文章：
