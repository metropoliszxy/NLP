一路走来 遇见大理驼峰

 I believe that art is the tangible manifestation of one’s soul. It is the very heart of wo/man as seen by the naked eye or perhaps the eye of God. Art is truth; in it, like in no other place, life can be seen for what it is rather than its ideal. Art is raw and exposed. I feel that each of my paintings may hold different meaning for anyone who views it. Most of my works make up a visual journal in which the common themes are loss of love, the potential loss of sanity, and the processes of healing that make up the human condition. They are my collective catharsis.这段话摘自</a> 来自艺术家Shannon Johnson。终于要结束这次诡异的行程，看着自己在纳木错那张傻气的照片，还觉得恍惚。庆幸没有在丽江多待片刻而是明智地去了海地。这才匆匆来到大理。早上还在洱海边的海地生活感慨万千，世间居然有如此宽敞的院子；中午到了湖的这边住了四季，却感到那家店极明显的冷漠感。晃到大理驼峰这里，还好，又重新拍了一下脑子。墙壁上有漂亮帅气的画作，Shannon Johnson 的画是一只巨鸟，像是一只机械猫头鹰；这只鸟旁边写着三个词：search for knowledge 。来自各地的艺术家们在他们的召唤之中，来到驼峰，在这里凭借自己的作品换换得了食宿和快乐。他们的网站上有句话，“驼峰能为大理做什么”。
