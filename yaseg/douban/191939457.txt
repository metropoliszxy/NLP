Although it has always been a beautiful holidayJesus did not ask us to remember him by celebrating his birthday, as millions do today. He left a simple instruction on how his followers were to remember him - through his life, death, and resurrection.耶稣没有让我们通过庆祝他的生日，像现今无数的人所做的那样来记念他。耶稣留下了简单的教导，让他的跟从者来领受如何记念他—通过他的生命，死亡和复活。The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remenbrance of me." In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, ''This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me." For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.  --- 1 Corinthians 11:23-28主耶稣被卖的那一夜，拿起饼来，祝谢了，就擘开，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的。你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。”饭后，也照样拿起杯来，说：“这杯是用我的血所立的新约。你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。”你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。 ---哥林多前书11:23-28
