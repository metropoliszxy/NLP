Sometimes When We Touch

You ask me if I love you and I choke on my replyI'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lieAnd who am I to judge you on what you say or doI'm only just begining to see the real youAnd sometimes when we touch the honesty's too muchAnd I have to close my eyes and hideI wanna hold you till I die till we both break down and cryI wanna hold you till the fear in me subsidesRomance and all it's stategy leaves me battling with my prideBut through the insecurity some tenderness survesI'm just another writer still trapped within my truthA hesitant prize fighter still trapped within my youthAnd sometimes when we touch the honesty's too muchAnd I have to close my eyes and hideI wanna hold you till I die till we both break down and cryI wanna hold you till the fear in me subsidesAt times I'd like to break you and drive you to your kneesAt times I'd like to break through and hold you endlesslyAt times I understand you and I know how hard you've triedI've watched while love commands you and I've watched love pass you byAt times think we're drifters still searching for a friendA brother or a sister but then the passion flares againAnd sometimes when we touch the honesty's too muchAnd I have to close my eyes and hideI wanna hold you till I die till we both break down and cryI wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olivia。这个声音原来在两年前就听过了。居然没有记住这个好声音背后的名字。
