the christian louboutin sale art world’s annual hajj to Mia

The "bubbly" also played a central role at Bruce High Quality Foundation’s party to celebrate its new exhibition at the W Hotel, where Dom Perignon had signed on as the event’s sponsor. After  toiling in obscurity for a few years, the Bushwick, Brooklyn-born collective is moving in headier circles these days, as evidenced by the plush turnout, which included the likes of patrons Leo Villareal, Yvonne Force Villareal,  and the ever-present artist Terence Koh. Also on hand at the W Hotel was Vito Schnabel, who has backed some of the Foundation’s activities through his fledgling dealership. Other Schnabels,, namely Lola and Jaqueline were present, making it truly a family affair, albeit with its most famous member absent. If father Julian was there, he was playing it low-key,, which seems fitting: the  art world’s annual hajj to Miami is about new discoveries, and, at the W Hotel last night it seemed clear that a new generation was making it self known. 相关的主题文章：
