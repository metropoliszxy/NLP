Empty Horizon

I miss you like I'm losing my own lifeI'm drifting to somewhere I can't findResistance and the power to let goOf something I can't controlI try to reach youI am alive but I can't breatheOh so empty our horizonOf all the dreams that can't come trueIn my thriving glowing fantasiesI hide the laste of sinI can't forget the sweetness of your skinForgive me for beingI am alive(You are here)But I can't breathe(You cannot feel)Don't want to fell anymore(Don't want to be here anymore)I am deprived(Falling apart)Where are we going toInto an empty horizonDrop the mask and let my feelings inReveal your eyes that tell a million thingsI'm hereWe are here closer to each otherClose to each otherI need to reach youI'm here but I can't winI need to feel youI've been here all the timeWill you let me inInto your empty horizon?
