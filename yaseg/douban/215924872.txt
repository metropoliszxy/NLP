是谁炸死了他 之四

前文提到“唯一一个可能执行11月24日的任务的就是‘第307中型轰炸大队‘”，其实应该译成"第307中型轰炸联队"，即“the 307th Bombardment Wing”。附带说明，而不是“the 307th Bombardment Group",后者在1946年就是非现役了。第307中型轰炸大队的网址是November 24: To support the UN offensive beginning this day, B-29s attacked North Korean communications and supply centers and Yalu River bridges, while Fifth Air Force fighters intensified close air support missions, and FEAF Combat Cargo Command air-dropped ammunition to front-line troops. 这里有307BG在朝鲜战争期间的简单介绍：Operational Units during the Korean WarIn August 1950, the 307th deployed to Okinawa. Detached from SAC, it began operations under Far East Air Forces (FEAF) Bomber Command, provisional. The attached 306th Bomb Group transferred to its parent wing on September 1, 1950 and until February 10, 1951, the 307th had no tactical mission. On that date, wing resources were used to train the 6th Air Division at MacDill and the wing deployed without personnel to Kadena, where it absorbed resources of the 307th Bomb Group and began flying combat missions. By the end of the hostilities, the wing (including its tactical group) had flown 5,810 combat sorties in 573 combat missions. The wing remained in the Far East in combat ready status and on August 15, 1953, Kadena AB, Okinawa became its permanent base.307th Bombardment Group, Medium (August 1950 - February 1951)    370th Bombardment Squadron    371st Bombardment Squadron    372nd Bombardment Squadron StationsKadena AB, Okinawa, (August 1950 - June 1952)307th Bomb Wing307th Bomb Group/Wing LogoLogoAzure, a four-petalled dogwood bloom slipped Or.
