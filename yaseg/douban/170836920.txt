Off to see the universe.

I wanted to see the universe, all of time and space; everywhere and anywhere; every star that ever was. So I stole a Timelord, the only one mad enough. A boy and his box, through crimson stars and silent stars and tumbling nebulas like oceans set on fire, empires of glass and civilisations of pure thought and a whole, terrible, wonderful universe of impossibilities. Planets to save, civilizations to rescue, creatures to defeatâ€¦ and an awful lot of running to do."The Doctor, is he worth it?""You are worth fighting for."
