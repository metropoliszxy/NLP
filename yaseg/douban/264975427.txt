Outlaws Of Love-adam lambert

Oh, nowhere left to go.Are we getting closer, closer?No. All we know is No.Nights are getting colder, colderHey. Tears all fall the same.We all feel the rain.We can't change.Everywhere we go, we're looking for the sun.Nowhere to grow old. We're always on the run.They say we'll rot in hell, well I don't think we will.They've branded us enough. Outlaws of love.Scars make us who we are.Hearts and homes are broken, broken.Far, we could go so far，with our minds wide open, open.Hey. Tears all fall the same.We all feel the rain.We can't change.Everywhere we go, we're looking for the sun.Nowhere to grow old. We're always on the run.They say we'll rot in hell, well I don't think we will.They've branded us enough. Outlaws of love.Outlaws of love.Outlaws of love.Outlaws of love.Outlaws of love.昨天adam演唱会回来之后，就超爱这首歌！原来这首歌是他自己写的，歌词好悲伤阿，应该是他作为gay的心路历程吧
