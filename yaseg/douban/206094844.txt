关于牛肉粉的音乐和哲学思考

前情回顾：今儿中午又去吃花溪牛肉粉了。有一个同事在另一个building，也要去。吃货用中文问：“我们要去'捡'他吗？”——汗，pick up也不能这么直译吧？快到地儿，加拿大吃货就开始微微颤抖了：“I can't wait ...”点完餐等待时，吃货扇动着鼻翼，嗅着空气中的香味：“Oh, what a torture...”吃货开吃了，旁边人跟他聊天，他说：“Sorry, I can't think about anything else now, I need to concentrate on it.”同去的人问：“How about 老马拉面？”吃货：“It's ok, but only a poor substitute for 牛肉粉，very poor.”问：“So you like 粉 more than 面？”答：“No, not just 粉，but also the soup and everything, it's the total, like a symphony, you know, if you remove the drum from the symphony, the symphony is gone...”快吃完的时候，我说：“Do you feel a little sad when the 粉 is over?”吃货：“Sure, it's like a tragedy at the end of the opera, someone dies and the fat lady sings.”回来的路上。我：“也许我们不应该加粉。”吃货：“Yeah, I think so, too. You know, in good restraurant, they don't serve to make you full, but serve to make you a little less than full.”我：“Yes, quantity ruins quality.”吃货：“Human nature make us greedy.”我：“But smart man knows to control.”吃货：“We're smart, we realize that.“我：“We will not 加粉 next time.”吃货：“Agreed.”【花溪牛肉粉地址】上地东路上，六街与七街之间，德实大厦对面。 注意：口味人不同，前往须谨慎。
