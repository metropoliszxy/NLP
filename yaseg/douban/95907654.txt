Dear Partner. 发件人： M.S<msum2@btopenworld.com>;

Dear Partner.       I assume you and your family are in good health.I am the Foreign Operations Manager in African Development Bank Group here in Burkina Faso .  This being a wide world in which it can be difficult to make new acquaintances and because it is virtually impossible to know who is trustworthy and who can be believed, i have decided to repose confidence in you after much fasting and prayer.   It is only because of this that I have decided to confide in you and to share with you this confidential business.   In my bank; there resides an overdue and unclaimed sum of nine million six hundred thousand United States dollars ($9,600,000.00).  When the account holder suddenly passed away in a private jet crash, he left no beneficiary who would be entitled to the receipt of this fund.  For this reason, I have found it expedient to transfer this fund to a trustworthy individual with capacity to act as foreign business partner.  Thus i humbly request your assistance to claim this fund.     Upon the transfer of this fund in your account, you will take 45% as your share from the total fund, 10% will be shared to Charity Organizations in both country and 45% will be for me.Please if you are really sure you can handle this project, contact me immediatelyI am looking forward to read from you soon.ThanksYours Good friend,好牛比！这是国际骗子么……
