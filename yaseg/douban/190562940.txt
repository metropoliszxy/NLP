Chullo

 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaChullo (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtʃuʎo], from Aymara: ch'ullu) is an andean style of hat with earflaps, made from vicuña, alpaca, llama or sheep's wool.[1] Alpaca has wool-like qualities that help to insulate its wearer from the harsh elements in the Andean Mountain region. Chullos often have ear-flaps that can be tied under the chin, to further warm the wearer's head.Chullos have been used in the Andean Mountain region since pre-Hispanic times and wearing different types and colors has a significance among the Andean natives. Western fashionIn the late 2000s, the chullo became an extremely popular winter hat; it was seen often in popular culture of the time, arguably made most famous by the popularity of Snowboarding. It remains highly popular in North America, Europe, and of course Bolivia, Chile and Peru. Many metropolitan areas in the Western world have street vendors from Bolivia and Peru who set up tables on which they sell chullos and wallets that have been made in either country. In North America they are often referred to as Incan (or Inca) Hats, and sometimes as Sherpa Hats, as this type of hat also exists in Nepal, being worn by Nepali people; especially in the Himalayan Region.References^ Leslie, Catherine Amoroso (2007).
