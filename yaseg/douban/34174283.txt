In the moonlight I felt your heart Quiver like a bowstring's pulse In the moon's pure light, you looked at me Nobody knows your heartWhen the sun is gone I see you  Beautiful and haunting, but cold  Like the blade of a knife, so sharp and so sweet  Nobody knows your heart  All of your sorrow, grief and pain  Locked away in the forest of the night  Your secret heart belongs to the world  Of the things that sigh in the dark  Oh the things that cry in the dark
