THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

 Take me out tonightWhere there's music and there's peopleWho are young and aliveDriving in your carI never never want to go homeBecause I haven't got one anymoreTake me out tonightBecause I want to see peopleAnd I want to see lifeDriving in your carOh please don't drop me homeBecause it's not my home, it's their homeAnd I'm welcome no moreAnd if a double-decker busCrashes into usTo die by your sideIs such a heavenly way to dieAnd if a ten ton truckKills the both of usTo die by your sideWell the pleasure, the privilege is mineTake me out tonightTake me anywhere, I don't careI don't care, I don't careAnd in the darkened underpassI thought Oh God, my chance has come at lastBut then a strange fear gripped meAnd I just couldn't askTake me out tonightOh take me anywhere, I don't careI don't care, I don't careDriving in your carI never never want to go homeBecause I haven't got oneNo, I haven't got oneAnd if a double-decker busCrashes in to usTo die by your sideIs such a heavenly way to dieAnd if a ten ton truckKills the both of usTo die by your sideWell the pleasure, the privilege is mineThere is a light that never goes outThere is a light that never goes outThere is a light that never goes outThere is a light that never goes out真是浪漫啊唱到心坎儿里的
