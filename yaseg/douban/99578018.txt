with a sigh

Meanwhile the minister and his charge jogged leisurely along as they had been directed. It was not every morning that Mr. Bowen could take a drive; he kept no horse, and the kindness of a parishioner had furnished him the means of the present excursion. He enjoyed it with a zest proportioned to its rarity. The clear sky, the buttercup-enameled fields, the depth of shady woods, the gushes of perfume as stray winds stirred the clover,all the sweet picture of summer beanty and content moved him as it had moved Helen an hour before.Oh, said he, turning to his companion with a beaming face, isnt it enough to praise the Lord for that were alive on such a day ?But Sister Sayress countenance betrayed no answering gleam; a deeper sadness, rather, set¬tled on it. Ym glad you feel so, Brother Bowen, she replied; its the right way, I know, and Id rejoice to. But somehow most every thing makes my Tieart sink instead of rise. Itspart¬ly poor health, I suppose—and then theres other things, you know.Other things! The minister was well aware of all that summary included. One who shonld have been a help and stay but was now a grief and shame; poverty growing deeper every year; children coming up without a fathers care or guidance; prospects bad almost beyond the hope of brightening.Yes, I know, he answered, with a sigh; and its not much to the purpose that I do. I cant help you except with my prayers and a few friendly words. But Ill tell you who else knows, and its every thing to have him—its the Lord Jesus. There isnt a time you feel down¬hearted and discouraged that He isnt sorry for yon ; and if you can only look to Him with faith Hell snrely send you comfort. He can change all these things that trouble you, or, if He doesnt see fit to do it, He can turn every one of them into a blessing. Only look to Him and lean ■pon Him, Sister Sayres.
