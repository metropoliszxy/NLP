Shy Ronnie2 歌詞```

Rihanna:We at it again, everybody knows,Hands in the air, its a stick up, stick up,no funny business or you get lit up, lit up!You test I you gon' die,And at your funeral ya momma gon' cry.So customers kiss the floor floor,And clerks open cash drawers slow, slow.If you don’t wanna end up dead,You do everything Shy Ronnie says!Tell them Ronnie!Rihanna:No one in the bank can hear you,Shy Ronnie use your outside voice!We don’t have time for this!Let’s go!So stay on the ground its a stick up, stick up!Your wallets and jewels we'll pick up, pick up!Unload the cash, move your ass,We gettin money, tell them Shy Ronnie!Please, please use your words!Just imagine that everyone's naked.Uh, oh!Boner alert! He really pictured them naked.The police are on there way, Good luck Shy Ronnie!Bye, bye!Ronnie:Ronnie motha fucka and I'm back from the dead,Played golf with the burner,so I shot my own leg.Don't get the name twisted, cause I’m crazy as sh*tI hung a giant ass noose off my giant ass d*ck...Rihanna:Ay! I forgot this money,And also this guy!Come on, we gonna have sex!Too-da-loo!Ronnie:...And you could hang from it,Cause you don’t wanna see my real gun,Shots to the sky but your face sound real fun!Ronnie!
