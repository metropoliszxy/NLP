The Mechanic

I read a essay about the film on the English-studying website I usually go to these days. It says the film is directed by Simon West, who is also the director of the famous Tomb Raider. The film is a remake of the 1972 Action Thriller, and going to be released in the spring of 2011. It describes an elite assassin and his apprentice. There is a very close relationship between the two guys, They make a series of actions to eliminate different targets, and then, the assassin find out why the apprentice makes an effort to get near him. It seems so exciting. I just canâ€™t wait to watch it!
