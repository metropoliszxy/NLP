Do not despair

We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.Our knowledge has made us cynical,our cleverness hard and unkind.We think too much and feel too littleMore than machinery,we need humanityMore than cleverness,we need kindness and gentleness.Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.
