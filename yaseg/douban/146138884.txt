“因為你不是在為我燃燒”

I like it that you're burning not for me,I like it that it's not for you I'm burning.And that the heavy sphere of sphere Earth,Will underneath our feet no more be turning.I like it that I can be unabashed,And humorous and not to play with words,And not to redden with a smothering wave,When with my sleeves I'm lightly touching yours.  I like it, that before my very eyesYou calmly hug another; it is wellThat for me also kissing someone elseYou will not threaten me with flames of hell.That this my tender name, not day nor night,You will recall again, my tender love;That never in the silence of the church,They will sing "halleluiah" us above.    With this my heart and this my hand I thankYou that - although you don't know it -You love me thus; and for my peaceful nightsAnd for rare meetings in the hour of sunset,That we aren't walking underneath the moon,That sun is not above our heads this morning,That you - alas - are burning not for me,And that - alas - it's not for you I'm burning.-------------------------------------------------------------我希望自己夠強大，夠豐盛，希望自己被人愛。這些渴望在我身體裏點起一團火，我竭力護住它，靠它取暖。我再也不亂花錢了。再也不給自己亂買東西了。再也不要神馬願望清單了。就讓我為你起舞吧。讓我為你唱首歌。讓我為你唱首歌。
