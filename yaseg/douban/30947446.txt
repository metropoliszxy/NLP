a sunshine day

Â I'm listenning to a beatiful song ,so sweet more than i can discrabe it. i sometimes fall into a kind of thought and can not get rid of it . I wish i was only a child.The life force me to face it. There is something like someone put a huge stone in my heart .move on .and keep turning.a serious examnation is waiting for me .. a kind of life i had  choosed is waiting  for me .a kind of sunshine day is far away or flying away ///
