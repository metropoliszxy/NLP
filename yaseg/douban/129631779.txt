young for you

sunday's coming i wanna drive my car to your apartment with present like a star forecaster said the weather may be rainy hard but i know the sun will shine for us oh lazy seagull fly me from the dark i dress my jeans and feed my monkey banana then i think my age how old,skyline how far or we need each other in california you show me your body before night comes down i touch your face and promise to stay ever young on this ivory beach we kissed so long it seems that the passion's never gone you sing me your melody and i feel so please i want you to want me to keep your dream together we'll run wild by a summer symphony this is what we enjoyed not a fantasy the tin-man's surfing i wanna try my luck to the top of tide rip like just have some drugs i know you have no blame for my proud moonish heart the golden beatnik park oh diamond seashore drag me from the yard incredible sunward i watch as you're in photograph for camera your smile's so sweet,palm trees' so lush would you believe my honey it's califoniahttp
