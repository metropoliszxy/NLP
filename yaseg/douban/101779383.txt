失控

这是怎么了，看到一个自己喜欢的人，就会无时无刻的想去看他的主页、相册，关心他的一举一动，研究他写过的每篇日记，试探着跟他搭讪，忍受他的爱答不理。说实话，我对他并不了解。花痴了，失控了。是该清醒一下了，期待爱的来临，即便它让人受伤。我也真的想尝试一回，刻骨铭心，一次足矣。————————————————————————————————————————love of my life you've hurt meyou've broken my heartand now you leave melove of my life can't you seebring it back bring it backdon't take it away from mebecause you don't knowwhat it means to melove of my life don't leave meyou've taken my loveyou now desert melove of my life can't you seebring it back bring it backdon't take it away from mebecause you don't knowwhat it means to meyou will rememberwhen this is blown overand everything's all by the waywhen i grow olderi will be there at your side to remind youhow i still love youi still love youback hurry backplease bring it back home to mebecause you don't knowwhat it means to melove of my lifelove of my lifeyeah
