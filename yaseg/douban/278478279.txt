refuge, consolation, and fun

Entre Tinieblas,Once again, without speaking;Once again, I walk the same old path.Wherever my feet take me, I wonder if I will ever find you again.And once again, my dreams wil be filled with my illusions, I'll love as much as i can love, and I'll forget as much as I should forget.For you I won't even have one miserable look;it was better to bury in the past, your forbidden love.Again I walk the same old path;again with a smile upon my face.If I came to your love it was just because I did;and if I left your love it was just because I did.And once again I walk the same old path,again with a smile upon my face.If I came to your love it was just because I did,and if i left your love it was just because I did.I came here because i came,and I left because I left.I love all that I can,and keep walking that old path.I keep walking on that path,walking where I want to go.Nothing you say, Mother, can make me change.Now everything is different, things aren't what they were.I'm alone, I'm very happy and my life is all on my own.But life is a comedy;this is the university.If you don't know where you are,you aren't going anywhere.I came here because i came,and I left because I left.I love all that I can,and keep walking that old path.Song Clips:
