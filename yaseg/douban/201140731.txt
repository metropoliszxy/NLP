Don't you bring me down today

Â Don't you bring me down todayDon't look at meEvery day is so wonderfulAnd suddenly, i saw debrisNow and then, I get insecureFrom all the pain, I'm so ashamedI am beautiful no matter what they sayWords can't bring me downI am beautiful in every single wayYes, words can't bring me downSo don't you bring me down todayTo all your friends, you're deliriousSo consumed in all your doomTrying hard to fill the emptinessThe piece is gone left the puzzle undoneThat's the way it isYou are beautiful no matter what they sayWords can't bring you downYou are beautiful in every single wayYes, words can't bring you downDon't you bring me down today...No matter what we do(no matter what we do)No matter what they say(no matter what they say)When the sun is shining throughThen the clouds won't stayAnd everywhere we go(everywhere we go)The sun won't always shine(sun won't always shine)But tomorrow will find a wayAll the other times'cause we are beautiful no matter what they sayYes, words won't bring us down, oh noWe are beautiful in every single wayYes, words can't bring us downDon't you bring me down todayDon't you bring me down todayDon't you bring me down todayBeautiful Christina Aquilera
