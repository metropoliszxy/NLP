THE ROSE

 [THE ROSE]some say love it is a river that drowns tender reedsome say love it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleedsome say love it is a hunger that endless aching needi say love it is a flower and you it's only seed*it's the heart afriad of breaking that never learns to danceit's the dream afriad of waking that never takes the chanceit's the one who won't be taken who can not seem to giveand the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live*when the night has been too lonelyand the road has been too longand you think thatlove is not only for the lucky and the strongjust remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snowlies the seed that with the sun's lovein the spring becomes the rose
