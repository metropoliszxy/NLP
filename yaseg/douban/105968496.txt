欲望都市的台词－句句箴言

If a man is over 30 and single, there's something wrong with him. It's Darwinian. They're being weeded out from propagating the species. What about us? We're just choosey.Once you try to change a man, it's doomed. They won't budge. The things you can work on are hair and wardrobe. Even then, it's a constant battle. It's about the fact that I wasn't even a factor in his decision-making process.Men do this all the time. Gays walking around thinking ''we.'' And their version of ''we'' is ''me and my dick.'' Tell a man, ''I hate you'', you'll have the best sex of your life. But tell him, ''I Love you'', you'll probably never see him again. We spent our childhoods playing games.Were they all just primers for the games we played as adults?Were relationships just a big chess match: strategy moves, countermoves......all designed to keep your opponent off balance until you win?Was there such a thing as an honest relationship?Or was it true?Do you have to play games to make a relationship work?In love relationships, there is a fine line between pleasure and Pain.In fact, it's a common belief that a re-lationship without Pain......is a rela-tionship not worth having.To some, Pain implies growth.But how do we know when the grow-ing Palns stop......and the ''Pain Pains'' take over?Are we masochists or optimists, if we continue to walk that Fine line?When it comes to relationships......how do you know when enough is enough?
