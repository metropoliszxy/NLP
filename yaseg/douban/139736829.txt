The future is all have left

someday, look back on a, young day we shared, we learned we had, we lost 　　 because you know tomorrow had another plan because you lose the future is all we have left 　　 one pain, one hope too far, so close we laugh, we cry we live, we grow 　　 because… because we know the future is all we have left 　　 one day, somewhere hold on, somewhere we stand, we leap we fall, we go 　　 because you know tomorrow plays another hand because we lose the future is all we have left 　　 because someday surely someday surely someday--------------------------------------------------------------------one pain, one hopetoo far, so closeyou laugh, you cryyou live, you growbecause…because you know the future is all have left.
