Steve Jobs Dies

Steve Jobs suddenly left. I learned of the news on my iPhone, in a shopping mall. So many things are being said about him. I have nothing to add. This is a heroless age.Yet my own life was touched so many times by this complete stranger:  Apple II, Mac, NeXTSTEP, Toy Story, iPhone, iPad, Apple Inc.And Douban, born on a worn-out Powerbook G4.Now there is an emptiness in many people's hearts. Yet on death itself, who could have said it better than Steve himself:"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€” which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. "Thank you, Steve.  Bravo.
