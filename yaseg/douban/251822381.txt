i still don't know what i was waiting fora big love to fall down from the skyshe took my hand and picked me up off the floorshe put an apple in my eyei said i'm tiredcome get me off the merry-go-roundi'm wiredcome feed me and then bring me downshe come up to mei can't remember what she saidcause i was in a trance and i forgot it alli bet you don't know about all thatrevolution in her headshe make a lover seem so magicalshe said i'm tiredcome get me off the merry-go-roundi'm wiredwell heaven must of sent youto save me from the rapture... yeahi'm tiredcome get me off the merry-go-roundi'm wiredcome feed me and then bring me down ------贴歌词
