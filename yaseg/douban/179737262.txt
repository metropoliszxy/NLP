找好久的 Andain 《Beautiful Things》

Andain 《Beautiful Things》Got up early, found something's missingmy only name.No one else sees but I got stuck,and soon forever came.Stopped pushing on for just a second, then nothing's changed.Who am I this time, where's my nameI guess it crept away.No one's calling for me at the door.And unpredictable won't bother anymore.And silently gets harder to ignore.Look straight ahead, there's nothing left to see.What's done is done, this life has got it's hold on me.Just let it go, what now can never be.I forgot that I might see,So many beautful things.I forgot that I might need,to find out what life could bring.Take this happy ending away, it's all the same.God won't waste this simplicity on possibility.Get me up, wake me up, dreams are fillingthis trace of blame.Frozen still I thought I could stop,now who's gonna wait.No one's calling for me at the door.and unpredictable won't bother anymore.and silently gets harder to ignore.look straight ahead, there's nothing left to see.what's done is done, this life has got it's hold on me.just let it go, what now can never be.so many beautiful things...so many beautiful things...Now what do I docan I change my minddid I think things throughIt was once my lifeit was my life at one time
