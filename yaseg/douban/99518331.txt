Nissan Consult ECU Diagnostic Interface

The Nissan Consult ECU  lets you use your computer to diagnose engine problems and even fix them yourself! This diagnostic cable and a laptop computer are all you need to begin diagnosing and repairing your Nissan car right away. This cable supports real-time engine sensor monitoring and logging, active engine tests and work support, engine self learn control, and ECCS log file replay. You can also display the status of the input and output signals at the engine control unit (ECU), read the conclusions of the error log, and display the name of failed circuits. Once you have located the source of a problem, you can begin troubleshooting it immediately. Your local mechanic charges an arm, a leg, and a piece of your fender for each and every one of these tests, so this cable will effectively pay for itself with the money you save on visits to the mechanic. Using this cable and any compatible software you download from the internet is easy. There is no need to physically replace chips, connect extra wires, or adjust hardware. Just connect one end of the cable to your computer's RS232 port and the other end to your Nissan's 14-pin Consult port, which is normally located near the fuse box. You can now use the your favorite software (such as ConZult, ScanTechNissan, Z-Control, SRTalk, or other compatible software) to access your Nissan's data. It's that easy! Professional and amateur mechanics as well as anyone concerned with the performance of their Nissan will love this product. Take advantage of our unbeatable low price to try one out today. Order in bulk to enjoy even greater savings and stock up for your store or for beating the competition on eBay! From your best source of high-tech, low price gadgets, Chinavasion.
