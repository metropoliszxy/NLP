A fiction about a little unicorn in my dream

( I'm a boring intern girl, I write things to kill time)Last night I had a weird dream.I dreamt a small unicorn flying around me.He seemed really lingering and would not be willing to leave.He picked me a blossom of rosemary and wiped my messy hair with his nose.I could feel the tenderness from his eyes.I asked him: what do you want?He blinked and burst into tears.I wished that he could talk.But he can’t.Then I looked at him carefully from head to toe.I decided to figure out the reason why he’s coming here.He had the most beautiful white hair on his back.It was silky like ribbon on a well-dressed little prince.And his eyes were tremendously deep pure blue.Like blue diamonds, but with hundreds mirrors to be reflected.I swear it was the most beautiful color I have ever seen.(Not finished yet)
