Excellent！

    IT is very excellent performance with all the cast in the first episode of the 6th season of the Criminal Minds I v just watched. BRAVO! Beside the main roles, the girl who was hostaged showed impressive tough mind and the final tear dropping probably be the highlight of the whole story and a good end attracting as much. She will be a great one, I guess.    That is the first thing I should transfer to everyone, and another one is the mistery of the psychological steam which emerged along with the plot , especially the reason the killer travelled around the states and get the killing way all along with. Obviously, the scenarist didnt tell me the real  deep reason, but that really stirred me up to be curious.Why does he kill people for satisfication, what does the early age memory influenced on him and made him a serial killer? and how come the experience related to his behavior? so much misery and mistery. May be some day it would take me a lot of time to discovering.     Good hopes and wishes to the team of Criminal Minds, and wish the episodes followed would make me absorbed as before.    "A family is a place where minds come in contact with one another, if these minds love one another, the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden,but if these minds get out of harmony with one another, it is like the storm that plays havoc with the garden."                                                                                           -----------The Budda     GOOD LUCK TO ALL.
