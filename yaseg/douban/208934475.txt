how i met and married her

kindle is my first woman. kindle is petite, because of so too jealous of big-size PDFs, sometimes totally repulsing them. the problem is i can't seem to go without my PDF amigos. besides, kindle gives no response whenever i touch her. she is icy cold. as always. which is enough to crush any man's balls. most intolerable is, however, that in darkness i can't do anything private to her! thinking i'm a normal adult!one morning when i woke up i beheld kindle, right next to me. wondering at her beauty, that of my goddess, my wife-to-be, i involuntarily pushed myself to her, offering to kiss and hug. we were so close i swear i was about to melt in her sweet breath and soft bosom. saddly if only time had stopped then! before i realized she turned her back, jumped off the bed. imprinted in my mind are her last look at me, that look of death, and her eternal cold face. she was broken. dead.  a month later, on one visit to apple store, i noticed Ipad. the next time i visited there, i encountered her again. after a while of small talk, i popped the question and asked her to marry me. i had no idea why i did that but she said yes, and came home with me. that day.sex since has been great. life has never been so colorful. i've got it over with quickly. though it costs more to please Ipad, and almost on a daily basis do i have to take care of her so we don't run out of the power of love, i'm happy when we are together. Ipad is friendly to all my pdf amigos, and my new epub fellas i recently made. i still think of kindle from time to time, though something still puzzles me: if she loved me, why she rejected me? if she had hope, why she ended herself first?
