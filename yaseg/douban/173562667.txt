110920 I Dream of Chicago

I've been a lot of placesMy feet have kissed this landI try real hard to remember all the facesBut none seem to have what yours demandsI took a train to chicagoThought I could clear my mindI took a plane out to find some truthBut all I found I can't seem to leave behindI dream of chicagoI dream of our youthI dream I could go and say all the thingsThat I never said to youI'm sure I used to love youAnd I'm sure you made me such a foolBut you were silent with your heart and affectionsTell me, girl, what's a boy supposed to do?I dream of chicagoI dream of our youthI dream I could go back and say all the thingsThat I never said to you大概冥冥中，就是与芝加哥有个缘。The Chicago Code片尾的这首歌的词，像是在唱我的某种情绪。写下这片日志，也是对自己的一个勉励。The city of wind, see you next summer.
