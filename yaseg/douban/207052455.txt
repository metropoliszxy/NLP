vanilla twilight

the stars lean down to kiss you and i lie awake and miss you pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere 'cause i'll doze off safe and soundly but i'll miss your arms around me i'd send a postcard to you dear 'cause i wish you were here 星星俯下身去吻你我却想你想得无法入眠给我一大份空气吧这样我才能安然入睡但还是会想念你抱着我的感觉我会给你寄张明信片因为我希望你在身边i'll watch the night turn light blue but it's not the same without you because it takes two to whisper quietly the silence isn't so bad till i look at my hands and feel sad 'cause the spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly 看着夜空慢慢透出淡蓝但没有了你这一切都毫无意义因为我想和你轻声低语最初并没觉得这寂静有什么不好直到低头看见了自己的手因为只有与你十指紧扣才能填补指间的空隙 i'll find repose in new ways though i haven't slept in two days 'cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone but drenched in vanilla twilight i'll sit on the front porch all night waist-deep in thought because when i think of you i don't feel so alone 我辗转反侧尽管已有两日未眠是因为这思念冷入骨髓浸润在这香草味道笼罩的暮光里我愿整夜坐在门前陷入到肆意生长的思念中因为只有当我想起你时才不会觉得自己是那么寂寞i don't feel so alone i don't feel so alone 我不觉得那么孤单不觉得那么寂寞as many times as i blink i'll think of you tonight i'll think of you tonight 我多眨一次眼睛今夜就会多想你一次 今夜就会多想你一次 when violet eyes get brighter and heavy wings grow lighter i'll taste the sky and feel alive again and i'll forget the world that i knew but i swear i won't forget you oh, if my voice could reach back through the pasti'll whisper in your earoh,darling.i wish you were here当紫色的眼睛明亮起来沉重的羽翼变得轻盈我会飞上天空 就像获得了新生忘记了那曾经熟悉的世界但我发誓不会忘记你如果我的声音可以穿越时空回到过去我想在你耳边轻声低语亲爱的 我多希望你在这里好香艳的歌词 鄙人译 豆瓣FM请戳
