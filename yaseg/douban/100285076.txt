Schalke boss admits he may have to sell Manchester United target Manuel Neuer

Schalke coach Felix Magath has admitted that it may be impossible to keep goalkeeper Manuel Neuer , heavily linked with Manchester United , at the club. The 24-year-old is regarded as one of Europe’s best goalkeeping talents.  Manchester United goalkeeping coach Eric Steele watched Neuer last season and speculation has continued that the German stopper is being lined up as a potential replacement for 40-year-old Edwin Van der Sar when he retires.  Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has shown little faith that his current understudies at Old Trafford can fill the veteran keeper’s boots.Schalke have endured a terrible start to the season.  They are in the relegation zone of the Bundesliga and are suffering financial difficulties off the pitch.As a result, Schalke coach Felix Magath has admitted that some of his stars, particularly Neuer, may have to be offloaded.Speaking to German daily Bild, Magath said, “Of course I do not trust entirely that I will be able to keep Manuel Neuer and all the other players.”Attempting to sound upbeat though, Magath added, “Although the situation is somewhat more difficult with less revenue, we have created the conditions to become champions in years to come.”Neuer’s Schalke contract expires in 2012, meaning that he could be available for a knock-down price next year.He is renowned as a goalkeeper who dominates his penalty area and has excellent reflexes.  He has 15 German international caps to his name.
