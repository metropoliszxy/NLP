1.1 Preliminaries 1.1.1 Learning a Language Programming a computer is both a creative activity and a process structured by rules. Computers are programmed or given instruction, through the use of Supra Shoes programming languages, so to program a computer, one must learn a programming language. The goal of this book is to introduce a programming language called Java.  Learning a programming language has similarities to learning a natural language, such as English or Spanish or Japanese. Natural languages have a lexicon, a syntax, and a semantics. The lexicon is the Supra Footwear vocabulary and punctuation. The rules of syntax dictate how the lexicon can be ordered to form correct sentences. The semantics conveys the meaning when the chosen words are combined in the chosen syntax of each sentence. The semantics changes, sometimes in subtle ways, depending on both the words chosen and the sentence syntax. Â So too, a programming language has lexical elements, a syntax, and a semantics. The lexical elements are comprised of keywords in the programming language, symbols such as arithmetic operators or parenthesis or braces, and words denoting identifiers by which we Supra Sneakers can name what is being operated upon. The syntax specifies precise rules for how the lexical elements are ordered to form correct language statements and programs. The semantics is the meaning of the constructed
