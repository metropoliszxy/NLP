Treat your nails to Chanel Nail Polish

When it comes to nails, Chanel knows it all.It's time to treat your nails to Chanel's Le Vernis nail polish collection during this chilly month of October. The La Vernis collection just launched the limited edition nail polish for the fall of  2010. One of the exclusive fashion-forward hues is Le Vernis Khaki Brun, a silky light brown, which is absolutely perfect for that ever-popular brown/camel leather jacket look.Chanel also launched a limited signature beauty carrying case which brings together three bottles of classic and runway-inspired shades.Rouge Noir, a devil red-like black, is a must-have color for every winter. It's neither simple black nor red, it's the perfect mix of these two! You can wear a black silky faux fur jacket with a pair of leather pants and add the Rouge Noir nail color to add some glamour.Gold-Lamé, a queen sparkling gold, is perfect for your Halloween dress code. Wear a simple jade, vintage cocktail dress with the Gold-Lamé nail shade.Last, but certainly not least, Coromandel is a Shanghai fiery red, which could be the highlight of an outfit. Add this nail color (and even some red lips) to an outfit composed of a high-waisted black skirt with a silk lace blouse and a metallic black belt, and you'll have the perfect outfit.Courtesy of Chanel Official Website
