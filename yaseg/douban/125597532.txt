现在要是问我，音乐有什么用，或者说音乐给你的最大的恩惠是什么，我会毫不犹豫的说，音乐是一个女孩儿腼腆的说：I want you的方式……

I’m your manIf you want a loverI’ll do anything you ask me toAnd if you want another kind of loveI’ll wear a mask for youIf you want a partnerTake my handOr if you want to strike me down in angerHere I standI’m your manIf you want a boxerI will step into the ring for youAnd if you want a doctorI’ll examine every inch of youIf you want a driverClimb insideOr if you want to take me for a rideYou know you canI’m your manAh, the moon’s too brightThe chain’s too tightThe beast won’t go to sleepI’ve been running through these promises to youThat I made and I could not keepAh but a man never got a woman backNot by begging on his kneesOr I’d crawl to you babyAnd I’d fall at your feetAnd I’d howl at your beautyLike a dog in heatAnd I’d claw at your heartAnd I’d tear at your sheetI’d say please, pleaseI’m your manAnd if you’ve got to sleepA moment on the roadI will steer for youAnd if you want to work the street aloneI’ll disappear for youIf you want a father for your childOr only want to walk with me a whileAcross the sandI’m your manIf you want a loverI’ll do anything you ask me toAnd if you want another kind of loveI’ll wear a mask for you
