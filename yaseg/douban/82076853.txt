Ideas about Liberal arts education

My ideas always come at midnight.Here's the thing. I've decided not to choose adult-edu course as my minor, instead, I will make a liberal arts education program for myself.Kind of like a second major.My major's name is Classical languages and Liberal Arts, which includes extensive reading and learning various classical languages. Languages to be learned are Ancient Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Persian, Hebrew and Ancient Chinese. Liberal arts plan includes Harvard Classics and the literatures related to the languages listed,and also ancient wisdom like Sumerian culture studies, Taoism, Buddhism and modern philosophy.Make it Clear:Languages and their literatures Part:First period: Sanskrit and Ancient Chinese (2010.8-2011.8)Second period: Ancient Greek and Latin (2011.8-2012.8)Third period: Hebrew and Persian (2012.8-2013.6)Liberal arts Part:First period: Harvard Classics Book 1-20 (arbitrary order) Second period: Harvard Classics Book 21-40 (arbitrary order)Third period: Harvard Classics Book 41-51 (arbitrary order) and modern philosophyAll set!
