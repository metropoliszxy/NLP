morning

The playground is still nowShadows dance aroundRaindrops are falling softly to the groundTomorrow's awaitingWith sunlight in her handMore time to play and draw pictures in the sandHush now baby, it's time to go to sleepMummy and Daddy have counted all the sheepHush now baby, don't you cryMummy and Daddy are always by your sideThe night has come nowThe sun has gone to restAll birds have stopped singingHinding in their nestThe stars are sparkling in the deep blue skyFrom the man in the moon you can hear a tired sighHush now baby, it's time to go to sleepMummy and Daddy have counted all the sheepHush now baby, don't you cryMummy and Daddy are always by your side
