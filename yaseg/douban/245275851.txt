勇气

Courage is a hard thing to figure. You can have courage based on a dumb idea or mistake, but you're not supposed to question adults, or your coach or your teacher, because they make the rules. Maybe they know best, but maybe they don't. It all depends on who you are, where you come from. Didn't at least one of the six hundred guys think about giving up and joining with the other side? I mean, Valley of Death, that's pretty salty stuff. That's why courage it's tricky. Should you always do what others tell you to do? Sometimes you might not even know why you're doing something. I mean any fool can have courage. But honor, that's the real reason, you either do something or you don't. It's who you are and maybe who you want to be. If you die trying for something important then you have both honor and courage and that's pretty good. I think that's what the writer was saying that you should hope for courage and try for honor. And maybe even pray that the people telling you what to do have some, too.—理解勇气是件困难的事，你可能会因笨主意或错误产生勇气。但你不应该去质疑长辈，不该去质疑你的教练、你的老师。因为他们定下了规则。他们也许是懂的最多的人，但也许不是。这都取决于你是谁，你来自哪里。难道不会有至少六百分之一的人考虑过放弃，并投靠去另一边？我是说，死亡之谷是个悲剧。所以勇气是很微妙的，你应该总是对别人言听计从吗？有时你可能甚至不知道你为什么这样做，任何蠢人都可能有勇气。但是荣耀，才是你有所为有所不为的真正原因，那才是真正的你，才是你想成为的你。若为重要的事情努力而失去生命，那么你就拥有荣耀和勇气，这样非常好。我认为这就是作者想要表达的，那就是你应该希望拥有勇气，努力得到荣耀。也许甚至恳求别人，教你如何来取得这些。
